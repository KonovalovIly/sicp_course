Evaluating (f f) results in an error because it reduces to (2 2), and 2 is not a procedure that can be applied to an argument. Here's the step-by-step reduction:
- (f f) expands to (f 2) because f applies its argument to 2.
- (f 2) then expands to (2 2), attempting to apply the number 2 as a procedure.
- This causes an error since numbers are not procedures in Scheme.

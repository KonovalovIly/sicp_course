### Understanding the Problem

First, let's recall what the golden ratio ϕ is. From Section 1.2.2 of the book, the golden ratio ϕ is defined as the positive solution to the equation:

$$ \phi = 1 + \frac{1}{\phi} $$

This equation suggests that ϕ is a fixed point of the transformation $$x \mapsto 1 + \frac{1}{x}$$, meaning that when we apply this transformation to ϕ, we get back ϕ itself.

### Verifying ϕ as a Fixed Point

Let's verify that ϕ satisfies the equation $$\phi = 1 + \frac{1}{\phi}$$:

1. Start with the definition of the golden ratio:
   $$\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$$ 
   Approximately,  $$\phi \approx 1.618033988749895$$.

2. Compute $$1 + \frac{1}{\phi}$$ :
   $$\frac{1}{\phi} = \frac{2}{1 + \sqrt{5}}$$
   To rationalize the denominator: $$\frac{2}{1 + \sqrt{5}} \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{1 - \sqrt{5}} = \frac{2(1 - \sqrt{5})}{(1)^2 - (\sqrt{5})^2} = \frac{2(1 - \sqrt{5})}{1 - 5} = \frac{2(1 - \sqrt{5})}{-4} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{-2} = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}$$
   So, $$1 + \frac{1}{\phi} = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} = \frac{2 + \sqrt{5} - 1}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \phi$$

This confirms that ϕ is indeed a fixed point of the transformation $$x \mapsto 1 + \frac{1}{x}$$.

### Computing ϕ Using the Fixed-Point Procedure

From the book, we have a `fixed-point` procedure that finds the fixed point of a function by repeatedly applying the function until the result doesn't change significantly. Here's how we can use it to compute ϕ:

1. **Define the Transformation**:
   The transformation is $$f(x) = 1 + \frac{1}{x}$$. In Scheme, this can be written as:
   ```scheme
   (define (f x) (+ 1 (/ 1 x)))
   ```

2. **Use the `fixed-point` Procedure**:
   Assuming we have the `fixed-point` procedure from the book (or we can define it as follows):
   ```scheme
   (define tolerance 0.00001)

   (define (fixed-point f first-guess)
     (define (close-enough? v1 v2)
       (< (abs (- v1 v2)) tolerance))
     (define (try guess)
       (let ((next (f guess)))
         (if (close-enough? guess next)
             next
             (try next))))
     (try first-guess))
   ```

3. **Compute ϕ**:
   Now, we can compute ϕ by finding the fixed point of `f` starting with an initial guess, say 1.0:
   ```scheme
   (fixed-point f 1.0)
   ```

   Let's trace the evaluation:
   - Start with guess = 1.0
   - next = (f 1.0) = 2.0
   - Not close enough (abs(1.0 - 2.0) = 1.0 > tolerance)
   - next guess = 2.0
   - next = (f 2.0) = 1.5
   - Not close enough (abs(2.0 - 1.5) = 0.5 > tolerance)
   - next guess = 1.5
   - next = (f 1.5) ≈ 1.6666666666666665
   - Not close enough (abs(1.5 - 1.666...) ≈ 0.166... > tolerance)
   - next guess ≈ 1.6666666666666665
   - next = (f 1.666...) ≈ 1.6
   - Not close enough (abs(1.666... - 1.6) ≈ 0.066... > tolerance)
   - next guess ≈ 1.6
   - next = (f 1.6) = 1.625
   - Not close enough (abs(1.6 - 1.625) = 0.025 > tolerance)
   - next guess = 1.625
   - next = (f 1.625) ≈ 1.6153846153846154
   - Not close enough (abs(1.625 - 1.615...) ≈ 0.0096 > tolerance)
   - next guess ≈ 1.6153846153846154
   - next = (f 1.615...) ≈ 1.619047619047619
   - Not close enough (abs(1.615... - 1.619...) ≈ 0.0037 > tolerance)
   - next guess ≈ 1.619047619047619
   - next = (f 1.619...) ≈ 1.6176470588235294
   - Not close enough (abs(1.619... - 1.617...) ≈ 0.0014 > tolerance)
   - next guess ≈ 1.6176470588235294
   - next = (f 1.617...) ≈ 1.6181818181818182
   - Not close enough (abs(1.617... - 1.618...) ≈ 0.00053 > tolerance)
   - next guess ≈ 1.6181818181818182
   - next = (f 1.618...) ≈ 1.6179775280898876
   - Not close enough (abs(1.618... - 1.617...) ≈ 0.00020 > tolerance)
   - next guess ≈ 1.6179775280898876
   - next = (f 1.617...) ≈ 1.6180555555555556
   - Not close enough (abs(1.617... - 1.618...) ≈ 0.000078 > tolerance)
   - next guess ≈ 1.6180555555555556
   - next = (f 1.618...) ≈ 1.6180257510729614
   - Not close enough (abs(1.618... - 1.618...) ≈ 0.000030 > tolerance)
   - next guess ≈ 1.6180257510729614
   - next = (f 1.618...) ≈ 1.6180371352785146
   - Not close enough (abs(1.618... - 1.618...) ≈ 0.000011 > tolerance)
   - next guess ≈ 1.6180371352785146
   - next = (f 1.618...) ≈ 1.6180327868852458
   - Now, abs(1.618037... - 1.618032...) ≈ 0.0000043 < tolerance
   - So, return ≈ 1.6180327868852458

   The exact value of ϕ is \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.618033988749895 \), so our approximation is quite close.

### Final Answer

Here's the complete Scheme code to compute ϕ using the fixed-point procedure:

```scheme
(define tolerance 0.00001)

(define (fixed-point f first-guess)
  (define (close-enough? v1 v2)
    (< (abs (- v1 v2)) tolerance))
  (define (try guess)
    (let ((next (f guess)))
      (if (close-enough? guess next)
          next
          (try next))))
  (try first-guess))

(define (golden-ratio)
  (fixed-point (lambda (x) (+ 1 (/ 1 x))) 1.0))

(golden-ratio) ; Expected to return approximately 1.618033988749895
```

### Verification

When you run `(golden-ratio)`, it should return a value very close to the known value of the golden ratio, \( \phi \approx 1.618033988749895 \). The exact value depends on the `tolerance` setting, but with `tolerance` set to `0.00001`, the result should be accurate to at least 5 decimal places.

### Key Takeaways

- **Fixed Point**: The golden ratio ϕ is a fixed point of the transformation $$x \mapsto 1 + \frac{1}{x}$$, meaning $$\phi = 1 + \frac{1}{\phi}$$ .
- **Fixed-Point Procedure**: By applying the `fixed-point` procedure to this transformation with an initial guess (e.g., 1.0), we can numerically approximate ϕ.
- **Convergence**: The procedure iteratively applies the transformation until the change between successive values is smaller than a specified tolerance, yielding a precise approximation of ϕ.

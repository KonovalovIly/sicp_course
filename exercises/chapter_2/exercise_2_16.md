### **Exercise 2.16: Why Equivalent Algebraic Expressions Yield Different Interval Results**

#### **1. The Core Problem: Dependency in Interval Arithmetic**
Interval arithmetic treats **each occurrence of a variable as independent**, even when they represent the same physical quantity. This leads to:
- **Overestimation of uncertainty**: When a variable appears multiple times (e.g., in \(A/A\)), the calculation assumes worst-case independence, artificially inflating the resulting interval.
- **Loss of correlation**: The relationship between repeated variables is ignored, causing equivalent expressions to diverge.

**Example**:
Let \( A = [1, 2] \).
- \( A/A \) mathematically equals 1, but interval arithmetic computes \([1, 2]/[1, 2] = [0.5, 2] \).
- The true result \([1, 1]\) is lost because the two \(A\)'s are treated as independent intervals.

---

#### **2. Why Equivalent Expressions Diverge**
| Expression          | Exact Value | Interval Arithmetic Result | Reason for Divergence               |
|---------------------|-------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| \( A/A \)           | \([1, 1]\)  | \([0.5, 2]\)               | Treats numerator/denominator as independent. |
| \( A \times A \)    | \([1, 4]\)  | \([1, 4]\)                 | No divergence (no division).         |
| \( \frac{1}{1/A} \) | \([1, 2]\)  | \([0.5, 2]\)               | Double inversion amplifies errors.   |

**Key Insight**:
Operations like division or subtraction **magnify uncertainty** when variables are repeated, while addition/multiplication of independent intervals are more stable.

#### **3. Can We Fix This? Challenges and Solutions**
##### **Approach 1: Symbolic Interval Arithmetic**
- **Idea**: Track dependencies symbolically (e.g., recognize \(A/A = 1\)).
- **Problem**:
  - Undecidable in general (equivalent to solving arbitrary mathematical identities).
  - Computationally infeasible for complex expressions.

##### **Approach 2: Affine Arithmetic**
- **Idea**: Represent intervals as linear combinations (e.g., \(A = c_0 + c_1 \epsilon_1\), where \(\epsilon_i\) are noise terms).
- **Pros**:
  - Preserves correlations between variables.
  - Handles linear dependencies perfectly (e.g., \(A/A = 1\)).
- **Cons**:
  - Fails for nonlinear operations (e.g., \(A \times B\)).
  - More complex than standard interval arithmetic.

##### **Approach 3: Probability-Guided Intervals**
- **Idea**: Use statistical distributions (e.g., Gaussian) instead of hard bounds.
- **Pros**:
  - Models real-world uncertainty better.
- **Cons**:
  - Loose guarantees (no strict bounds).
  - Not pure interval arithmetic.

##### **Approach 4: Algebraic Simplification**
- **Idea**: Simplify expressions before interval evaluation (e.g., rewrite \(A/A\) as 1).
- **Pros**:
  - Works for trivial cases.
- **Cons**:
  - Cannot automate for arbitrary expressions.

---

#### **4. Is a Perfect Solution Possible?**
- **No**, for a general-purpose interval-arithmetic package.
  **Reason**:
  - Determining if two expressions are equivalent is undecidable (related to the *halting problem*).
  - Even affine arithmetic fails for nonlinear cases.

- **But**: For **restricted use cases** (e.g., linear expressions), dependency can be tracked perfectly.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **Equivalent ≠ Identical in Intervals**:
   Algebraic equivalence doesn’t guarantee identical interval results due to lost correlations.
2. **Fundamental Limitation**:
   Perfect dependency tracking is impossible for arbitrary expressions.
3. **Practical Workarounds**:
   - Use **affine arithmetic** for linear problems.
   - Avoid repeated variables in formulas (e.g., prefer `par2` over `par1`).
   - Simplify expressions manually when possible.

**Final Answer**:
Equivalent algebraic expressions give different interval results because interval arithmetic ignores variable dependencies. While **no general solution exists**, advanced methods like affine arithmetic can help in specific cases. For critical applications, design formulas to minimize repeated variables (as Eva Lu Ator suggested).

**For the brave**:
If you attempt to build a "perfect" interval-arithmetic package, focus on:
- Hybrid symbolic-interval methods (for simple cases).
- Domain-specific restrictions (e.g., linear-only operations).
- Heuristics to detect common patterns (e.g., \(A/A\)).

But remember: **This problem is fundamentally hard**—hence the warning in the exercise!

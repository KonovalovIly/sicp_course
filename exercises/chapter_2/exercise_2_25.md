To extract the number `7` from each of the given lists using combinations of `car` and `cdr`, we need to traverse the nested list structure. Here are the correct expressions for each list:

### 1. `(1 3 (5 7) 9)`
The `7` is inside the sublist `(5 7)`, which is the third element of the main list.

**Steps:**
1. `cdr` twice to get to `((5 7) 9)`
2. `car` to get `(5 7)`
3. `cdr` to get `(7)`
4. `car` to get `7`

**Final expression:**
```scheme
(car (cdr (car (cdr (cdr '(1 3 (5 7) 9))))))
```
Or more concisely:
```scheme
(cadr (caddr '(1 3 (5 7) 9)))
```

### 2. `((7))`
The `7` is the only element inside a nested single-element list.

**Steps:**
1. `car` to get `(7)`
2. `car` again to get `7`

**Final expression:**
```scheme
(car (car '((7))))
```
Or more concisely:
```scheme
(caar '((7)))
```

---

### 3. `(1 (2 (3 (4 (5 (6 7))))))`
The `7` is deeply nested inside multiple sublists.

**Steps:**
1. `cdr` to get `((2 (3 (4 (5 (6 7))))))`
2. `car` to get `(2 (3 (4 (5 (6 7)))))`
3. `cdr` to get `((3 (4 (5 (6 7)))))`
4. `car` to get `(3 (4 (5 (6 7))))`
5. `cdr` to get `((4 (5 (6 7))))`
6. `car` to get `(4 (5 (6 7)))`
7. `cdr` to get `((5 (6 7)))`
8. `car` to get `(5 (6 7))`
9. `cdr` to get `((6 7))`
10. `car` to get `(6 7)`
11. `cdr` to get `(7)`
12. `car` to get `7`

**Final expression:**
```scheme
(car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr '(1 (2 (3 (4 (5 (6 7)))))))))))))))
```
Or more concisely:
```scheme
(cadadr (cadadr (cadadr '(1 (2 (3 (4 (5 (6 7)))))))
```
(Note: This can be written more compactly using nested `cadr` compositions, but the full form is shown for clarity.)

### Summary of Solutions:
1. **For `(1 3 (5 7) 9)`**:
   ```scheme
   (car (cdr (car (cdr (cdr '(1 3 (5 7) 9)))))  ; or (cadr (caddr lst))
   ```
2. **For `((7))`**:
   ```scheme
   (car (car '((7))))  ; or (caar lst)
   ```
3. **For `(1 (2 (3 (4 (5 (6 7))))))`**:
   ```scheme
   (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr lst))))))))))
   ```
   (Or using `cadadr` compositions if supported.)

These combinations correctly navigate the nested lists to extract `7`.

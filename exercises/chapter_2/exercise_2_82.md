## 🔁 Background: Two-Argument Coercion Strategy

In the previous version (`apply-generic` for two arguments), the strategy is:

1. Check if there's an operation defined for the current argument types.
2. If not, try coercing one argument to the type of the other:
   - Try `(coerce arg1 to arg2-type)` and apply operation.
   - Try `(coerce arg2 to arg1-type)` and apply operation.
3. If none work, raise an error.

This works well when only two arguments are involved.

## 🧠 Exercise 2.82: Generalizing to Multiple Arguments

Now, we need to generalize this idea to **more than two arguments**.

### ✅ Proposed Strategy:

Try to **coerce all arguments to each possible type** in turn (e.g., first try to make all arguments into the type of the first, then of the second, etc.), and see if any such uniform set of types has a corresponding operation.

Here’s how you might implement it in pseudocode or Scheme:

```scheme
(define (apply-generic op . args)
  (let ((type-tags (map type-tag args)))
    (let ((proc (get op type-tags)))
      (if proc
          (apply proc (map contents args))
          (let ((coercion-pathways (generate-coercion-pathways args)))
            (if coercion-pathways
                (apply apply-generic (cons op coercion-pathways))
                (error "No method for these types" (list op type-tags))))))))

(define (generate-coercion-pathways args)
  (define (coerce-all-to target-type args)
    (map (lambda (arg)
           (if (eq? (type-tag arg) target-type)
               arg
               (let ((coercion (get-coercion (type-tag arg) target-type)))
                 (if coercion
                     (coercion arg)
                     #f))))
         args))

  (define (try-coercions remaining-types)
    (if (null? remaining-types)
        #f
        (let ((coerced-args (coerce-all-to (car remaining-types) args)))
          (if (all? coerced-args) ; check if all coercions succeeded
              coerced-args
              (try-coercions (cdr remaining-types))))))

  (try-coercions (map type-tag args)))
```

### 💡 Explanation:

- We try coercing **all arguments to the type of each argument in turn**.
- For each attempt:
  - If any argument cannot be coerced to the target type, skip to the next target.
  - If all can be coerced, proceed with that set of coerced arguments.
- If no full coercion path works, return an error.

This allows us to try many combinations of coercion paths without hardcoding pairwise logic.

## ❗ Limitations of This Strategy

Despite being more general than the two-argument approach, this strategy still has limitations.

### 📌 Problem Case: Mixed-Type Operations

Suppose there exists an operation like:

```scheme
(put 'add '(complex scheme-number) ...)
```

That is, there's a way to add a complex number and a real number directly — but **not** by coercing both to the same type.

Our generalized strategy tries to **coerce all arguments to a single type**, and thus **never tries mixed-type operations** like this.

#### Example:

Let’s say we call:

```scheme
(add (make-complex-from-real-imag 1 2) (make-scheme-number 3))
```

If there's a method `(add complex scheme-number)` in the table, but our strategy tries to coerce both to `complex` or both to `scheme-number`, and either fails or is unnecessary, then we will **miss** the correct method.

Thus:

> The strategy of trying to coerce all arguments to a single type (in turn) may miss valid operations that require **mixed-type dispatch**.

---

## ✅ Summary

### ✅ Solution:
Generalize `apply-generic` to try coercing all arguments to the type of each argument in turn. If a consistent set of coerced arguments leads to a valid operation, use it.

### ❌ Limitation:
This strategy doesn’t consider **mixed-type operations**, even if such methods exist in the operation table. For example, `(op complex scheme-number)` would never be tried if we always try to unify types.

---

## 🧩 Optional Enhancement (Extra Credit)

To support mixed-type operations, you'd need a more sophisticated approach, such as:

- Maintaining a list of **coercion chains** between types (e.g., `scheme-number -> complex`)
- Trying **all combinations** of coercions across all argument types (combinatorially expensive!)
- Using a **heuristic-based search** through the space of type conversions

But that comes at the cost of performance and complexity.

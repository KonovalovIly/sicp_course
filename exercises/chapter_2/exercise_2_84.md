## üéØ Objective

You want `apply-generic` to try coercing all arguments to the **highest type among them**, so that a matching operation can be applied.

This requires:

1. A way to find the **type with the highest level** among the arguments.
2. A way to **successively raise** each argument to that type.
3. Then apply the generic operation on the raised arguments.

## üß± Step-by-Step Plan

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Define a Type Tower and Level Mapping

We define a list representing the type tower:

```scheme
(define tower '(integer rational real complex))
```

Then write a helper function to get the **level** of a type:

```scheme
(define (type-level type)
  (let loop ((t tower) (level 0))
    (cond ((null? t)
           (error "Type not in tower" type))
          ((eq? type (car t)) level)
          (else (loop (cdr t) (+ level 1))))))
```

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Determine the Highest Type Among Arguments

```scheme
(define (highest-type args)
  (define (select-higher t1 t2)
    (if (> (type-level t1) (type-level t2)) t1 t2))
  (let ((types (map type-tag args)))
    (if (null? types)
        (error "No types provided")
        (fold-left select-higher (car types) (cdr types)))))
```

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Raise an Object to a Target Type

Use the `raise` procedure from Exercise 2.83 repeatedly until the object reaches the desired type.

```scheme
(define (raise-to target-type x)
  (let loop ((x x))
    (let ((current-type (type-tag x)))
      (if (eq? current-type target-type)
          x
          (let ((raised (raise x)))
            (if raised
                (loop raised)
                (error "Cannot raise to target type" (list current-type target-type))))))))
```

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Coerce All Arguments to Same Type

```scheme
(define (coerce-all args target-type)
  (map (lambda (arg) (raise-to target-type arg)) args))
```

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Modify `apply-generic` to Use Coercion via Raising

Now integrate everything into `apply-generic`, reusing the original structure but adding coercion support.

```scheme
(define (apply-generic op . args)
  (let ((type-tags (map type-tag args)))
    (let ((proc (get op type-tags)))
      (if proc
          (apply proc (map contents args))
          (let ((target-type (highest-type args)))
            (let ((coerced-args (coerce-all args target-type)))
              (let ((coerced-types (map type-tag coerced-args))
                    (coerced-proc (get op coerced-types)))
                (if coerced-proc
                    (apply coerced-proc (map contents coerced-args))
                    (error "No method for coerced types"
                           (list op coerced-types))))))))))
```

## üîÅ Example Usage

Assume you're working with:

- `(make-integer 5)`
- `(make-real 3.14)`

Calling:

```scheme
(apply-generic 'add (make-integer 5) (make-real 3.14))
```

Should:

1. See that no operation exists for `(integer real)`
2. Find the highest type ‚Äî `real`
3. Raise the integer to `real`
4. Apply `add` on two `real` numbers

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What‚Äôs Not Covered?

This assumes that all types can be raised to a common type. Also, if multiple operations exist at different levels, it will always pick the **topmost**, which may not always be optimal.

Also, there is no backtracking or trying other combinations ‚Äî but within the constraints of the exercise, this is acceptable.

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Define a type tower and associated level mapping |
| 2 | Implement `highest-type` to find the dominant type |
| 3 | Implement `raise-to` to lift any object to a given target type |
| 4 | Implement `coerce-all` to convert all arguments to one type |
| 5 | Modify `apply-generic` to try coercion before error |

---

## üí° Why This Works Well

This approach is:
- **Extensible**: Adding new types just requires inserting them in the tower.
- **Modular**: Each type only needs to implement its own `raise` method.
- **Consistent**: Uses existing infrastructure (`raise`) and avoids ad-hoc coercion logic.

The key idea is:
- Define a **generic `project`** operation that lowers an object one level.
- Use this to check if an object can be lowered:
  If you project it, then raise it back, and get something **equal**, then it's safe to drop.
- Implement `drop` to lower an object as far as possible.
- Finally, use `drop` to simplify results returned by `apply-generic`.

## üß± Step-by-Step Plan

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Define the Type Tower

From Exercise 2.83:

```scheme
(define tower '(integer rational real complex))
```

We'll use this to determine the direction of projection.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Define Projection Functions

Projection means going **down** the type tower by one level.

#### 1. Complex ‚Üí Real

Discard the imaginary part:

```scheme
(define (complex->real z)
  (make-real (real-part (contents z))))
```

#### 2. Real ‚Üí Rational

Convert a real number to a rational approximation:

```scheme
(define (real->rational x)
  (let ((numerator (round (* (contents x) 1000)))) ; crude rational approx
    (make-rational numerator 1000)))
```

> Note: This is a simple approximation. In practice, you might want to use continued fractions or better rationalizers.

#### 3. Rational ‚Üí Integer

Only if the denominator is 1:

```scheme
(define (rational->integer r)
  (let ((n (car (contents r)))
        (d (cdr (contents r))))
    (if (= d 1)
        (make-integer n)
        (error "Cannot project rational to integer" r))))
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Generic `project` Operation

Install `project` as a generic operation:

```scheme
(define (install-project-package)
  ;; internal procedures
  (put 'project '(complex) complex->real)
  (put 'project '(real) real->rational)
  (put 'project '(rational) rational->integer)
  'done)

(define (project obj)
  (let ((proc (get 'project (list (type-tag obj)))))
    (if proc
        (proc obj)
        (error "No project method for type" (type-tag obj)))))
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Define Equality Predicate

Use the generic equality predicate from **Exercise 2.79**:

```scheme
(define (equ? a b)
  (apply-generic 'equ? a b))
```

Assuming you have implemented `'equ?` operations for each type.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Implement `drop`

Now we write `drop`, which attempts to lower an object as far as possible:

```scheme
(define (drop obj)
  (define (can-drop? x)
    (let ((projected (project x)))
      (and projected (equ? x (raise projected))))) ; safety check

  (if (memq (type-tag obj) '(integer)) ; already at bottom
      obj
      (if (can-drop? obj)
          (drop (project obj)) ; try dropping further
          obj)))
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 6: Modify `apply-generic` to Use `drop`

Update your `apply-generic` function from Exercise 2.84 to simplify its result using `drop`:

```scheme
(define (apply-generic op . args)
  (let ((type-tags (map type-tag args)))
    (let ((proc (get op type-tags)))
      (if proc
          (drop (apply proc (map contents args))) ; wrap result in drop
          (let ((target-type (highest-type args)))
            (let ((coerced-args (coerce-all args target-type)))
              (let ((coerced-types (map type-tag coerced-args))
                    (coerced-proc (get op coerced-types)))
                (if coerced-proc
                    (drop (apply coerced-proc (map contents coerced-args))) ; simplify
                    (error "No method for these types"
                           (list op type-tags))))))))))
```

---

## üîÅ Example Usage

Let‚Äôs say we evaluate:

```scheme
(add (make-complex-from-real-imag 2 0) (make-complex-from-real-imag 3 0))
```

This would compute `(complex 5 + 0i)` ‚Äî but after applying `drop`, it becomes:

```scheme
(integer 5)
```

Because:
- It can be projected to real (`5.0`)
- Then raised back to complex (`5 + 0i`)
- So it‚Äôs safe to drop again to rational (`5/1`)
- And again to integer (`5`)

But if you had:

```scheme
(add (make-complex-from-real-imag 2 3) (make-complex-from-real-imag 4 1))
```

It results in `6 + 4i` ‚Äî cannot be dropped at all.

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Define projection functions for each type |
| 2 | Implement `project` as a generic operation |
| 3 | Implement `equ?` for comparing values across types |
| 4 | Write `drop` that uses `project` and `raise` to test whether lowering is valid |
| 5 | Update `apply-generic` to return simplified results via `drop` |

---

## üí° Why This Works Well

- **Robustness**: Only drops when the value remains equal after raising ‚Äî avoids unintended transformations.
- **Extensibility**: Adding new types just requires defining their `project` and `raise` behavior.
- **Consistency**: Uses existing infrastructure (`raise`, `project`, `equ?`) and fits cleanly into the system.

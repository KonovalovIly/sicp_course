### Understanding the Problem

We are given the following Scheme code and asked to explain the effect of `set-to-wow!` on the structures `z1` and `z2` using box-and-pointer diagrams.

```scheme
(define x (list 'a 'b))
(define z1 (cons x x))
(define z2 (cons (list 'a 'b) (list 'a 'b)))

(define (set-to-wow! x)
  (set-car! (car x) 'wow)
  x)
```

### Step 1: Drawing the Initial Structures

#### Structure of `z1`
- `z1` is created by `(cons x x)`, where `x` is `(list 'a 'b)`.
- This means both the `car` and `cdr` of `z1` point to the same list `x`.

Box-and-pointer diagram for `z1`:
```
z1: [•|•]
     | |
     v v
    [a|•]-->[b|/]
```

#### Structure of `z2`
- `z2` is created by `(cons (list 'a 'b) (list 'a 'b))`.
- Here, two separate lists `(list 'a 'b)` are created for the `car` and `cdr` of `z2`.

Box-and-pointer diagram for `z2`:
```
z2: [•|•]
     | |
     v v
    [a|•]-->[b|/]   [a|•]-->[b|/]
```

### Step 2: Applying `set-to-wow!` to `z1`

The `set-to-wow!` procedure:
```scheme
(define (set-to-wow! x)
  (set-car! (car x) 'wow)
  x)
```

#### Effect on `z1`
1. `(car z1)` is the list `x`, which is `(a b)`.
2. `(set-car! (car z1) 'wow)` modifies the `car` of `x` to `'wow`.

Since both the `car` and `cdr` of `z1` point to the same list `x`, modifying `x` affects both parts of `z1`.

Resulting structure of `z1`:
```
z1: [•|•]
     | |
     v v
    [wow|•]-->[b|/]
```

#### Printed Value of `z1`
```scheme
z1  ; → ((wow b) wow b)
```

### Step 3: Applying `set-to-wow!` to `z2`

#### Effect on `z2`
1. `(car z2)` is the first list `(a b)`.
2. `(set-car! (car z2) 'wow)` modifies the `car` of the first list to `'wow`.

The second list (in the `cdr` of `z2`) remains unchanged because it is a separate list.

Resulting structure of `z2`:
```
z2: [•|•]
     | |
     v v
    [wow|•]-->[b|/]   [a|•]-->[b|/]
```

#### Printed Value of `z2`
```scheme
z2  ; → ((wow b) a b)
```

### Key Observations

1. **Shared vs. Separate Structures**:
   - In `z1`, the `car` and `cdr` share the same list, so modifying one affects the other.
   - In `z2`, the `car` and `cdr` are separate lists, so modifying one does not affect the other.

2. **Mutation Side Effects**:
   - `set-car!` directly modifies the pair in memory, leading to visible changes in all references to that pair.
   - Understanding whether structures are shared is crucial when using mutating operations.

### Final Box-and-Pointer Diagrams

#### After `(set-to-wow! z1)`:
```
z1: [•|•]
     | |
     v v
    [wow|•]-->[b|/]
```

#### After `(set-to-wow! z2)`:
```
z2: [•|•]
     | |
     v v
    [wow|•]-->[b|/]   [a|•]-->[b|/]
```

### Printed Values Summary

- `z1` after `set-to-wow!`: `((wow b) wow b)`
- `z2` after `set-to-wow!`: `((wow b) a b)`

This exercise highlights how mutation can have different effects depending on whether data structures are shared or separate. Always be mindful of sharing when using mutable operations in Scheme!

To illustrate the evaluation of the given sequence of expressions using the procedural implementation of pairs, we'll step through each operation and visualize the environment structures.

### Procedural Implementation of Pairs
Pairs are implemented as procedures that dispatch on messages:
```scheme
(define (cons x y)
  (define (dispatch m)
    (cond ((eq? m 'car) x)
          ((eq? m 'cdr) y)
          (else (error "Undefined operation: CONS" m))))
  dispatch)

(define (car z) (z 'car))
(define (cdr z) (z 'cdr))
(define (set-car! z new-value)
  (define (dispatch m)
    (cond ((eq? m 'car) new-value)
          ((eq? m 'cdr) (cdr z))
          (else (error "Undefined operation: SET-CAR!" m))))
  (set! z dispatch))

(define (set-cdr! z new-value)
  (define (dispatch m)
    (cond ((eq? m 'car) (car z))
          ((eq? m 'cdr) new-value)
          (else (error "Undefined operation: SET-CDR!" m))))
  (set! z dispatch))
```

### Evaluation Steps
1. **`(define x (cons 1 2))`**
   - Creates a pair `x` where `car` is `1` and `cdr` is `2`.
   - Environment diagram:
     ```
     Global Env:
       x: dispatch (with env E1)
       E1: x = 1, y = 2
     ```

2. **`(define z (cons x x))`**
   - Creates a pair `z` where both `car` and `cdr` point to `x`.
   - Environment diagram:
     ```
     Global Env:
       x: dispatch (with env E1)
       z: dispatch (with env E2)
       E1: x = 1, y = 2
       E2: x = x (from E1), y = x (from E1)
     ```

3. **`(set-car! (cdr z) 17)`**
   - `(cdr z)` evaluates to `x`.
   - `(set-car! x 17)` modifies the `car` of `x` to `17`.
   - Environment diagram after mutation:
     ```
     Global Env:
       x: dispatch (with env E1-modified)
       z: dispatch (with env E2)
       E1-modified: x = 17, y = 2
       E2: x = x (from E1-modified), y = x (from E1-modified)
     ```

4. **`(car x)`**
   - Evaluates to `17` because the `car` of `x` was modified to `17`.

### Final Environment Structure
- **`x`**: Points to a procedure (initially `car=1`, `cdr=2`), then modified to `car=17`, `cdr=2`.
- **`z`**: Points to a procedure where both `car` and `cdr` point to `x`.

### Box-and-Pointer Diagrams
1. After `(define x (cons 1 2))` and `(define z (cons x x))`:
   ```
   z: [•|•]
      /   \
     x     x
     [1|2]
   ```

2. After `(set-car! (cdr z) 17)`:
   ```
   z: [•|•]
      /   \
     x     x
     [17|2]
   ```

### Key Observations
- **Procedural Pairs**: Each pair is represented as a closure with its own environment.
- **Mutation**: `set-car!` creates a new closure for `x` with updated values, and `z`'s references to `x` now point to the modified `x`.
- **Result**: `(car x)` correctly returns `17` after mutation.

This demonstrates how mutation works in a purely functional representation of pairs, where each "pair" is a procedure that captures its state in an environment.

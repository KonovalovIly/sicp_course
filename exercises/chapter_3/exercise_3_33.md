### Averager Constraint Implementation

To create an averager using primitive constraints, we'll need to express the relationship c = (a + b)/2 using the available constraints (adder, multiplier, and constant).

#### Solution Code
```scheme
(define (averager a b c)
  (let ((sum (make-connector))
        (two (make-connector)))
    (adder a b sum)
    (constant 2 two)
    (multiplier c two sum)
    'ok))
```

### Explanation

1. **Components Used**:
   - One adder constraint
   - One multiplier constraint
   - One constant constraint (value = 2)

2. **Mathematical Relationship**:
   - First, we compute the sum: `sum = a + b`
   - Then we establish that `sum = c * 2` (which is equivalent to `c = sum/2`)

3. **Connector Setup**:
   - `sum` holds the result of a + b
   - `two` is a constant connector with value 2
   - The multiplier enforces `c × 2 = sum`

4. **Constraint Network**:
   ```
   a ───┐
        ⊕ ── sum ──⊠── c
   b ───┘         ╱
                2
   ```

### Usage Example

```scheme
(define a (make-connector))
(define b (make-connector))
(define avg (make-connector))

(averager a b avg)

(probe "Average" avg)

(set-value! a 10 'user)
(set-value! b 20 'user)
; Probe: Average = 15

(forget-value! a 'user)
(set-value! avg 15 'user)
(set-value! a 10 'user)
; Probe: b = 20
```

### Key Features

1. **Bidirectional Computation**:
   - Can compute average from inputs
   - Can compute missing input from average and one input

2. **Constraint Satisfaction**:
   - Maintains the relationship regardless of which values are set
   - Propagates values through the network

3. **Efficiency**:
   - Uses minimal constraints (1 adder, 1 multiplier)
   - No redundant computations

This implementation properly establishes the averager relationship while working within the constraint system's capabilities. The solution is elegant in its simplicity and leverages the bidirectional nature of the constraint system.

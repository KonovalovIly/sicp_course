### Environment Diagram Analysis

Let's analyze the environment structure when `(for-each-except setter inform-about-value constraints)` is evaluated during `(set-value! a 10 'user)`.

#### Global Environment
```
Global Env:
  make-connector: <procedure>
  set-value!: <procedure>
  a: <connector> (with env E1)
  b: <connector> (with env E2)
```

#### Connector a's Environment (E1)
```
E1 (for connector a):
  value: 10
  informant: 'user
  constraints: <list of constraints>
  set-value!: <procedure>
  forget-value!: <procedure>
  connect: <procedure>
  me: <dispatch procedure>

  Local procedures:
    set-my-value: (lambda (newval setter) ...)
    forget-my-value: (lambda () ...)
    connect: (lambda (new-constraint) ...)
    for-each-except: <procedure>
```

### Evaluation Context

When `set-value!` is called on connector `a`:
1. `set-value!` calls `a`'s local `set-my-value` procedure
2. During execution, it reaches:
   ```scheme
   (for-each-except setter inform-about-value constraints)
   ```

### Environment During Evaluation

The expression is evaluated in the following environment structure:
```
Evaluation Env (for the for-each-except call):
  ┌───────────────────────┐
  │ Local bindings:       │
  │   setter: 'user       │
  │   inform-about-value: <procedure> │
  │   constraints: <list> │
  ├───────────────────────┤
  │ Outer env: E1         │ ← Connector a's environment
  └───────────────────────┘
    │
    ├─ value: 10
    ├─ informant: 'user
    ├─ constraints: [...]
    └─ Local procedures...
```

### Key Observations

1. **Free Variables**:
   - `for-each-except` is found in E1 (connector's local environment)
   - `setter` is bound to `'user` in the local procedure call
   - `inform-about-value` refers to a constraint's method
   - `constraints` is the connector's list of constraints

2. **Environment Chain**:
   - The evaluation happens within `set-my-value`'s execution
   - Which is within the connector `a`'s local environment (E1)
   - Which itself points to the global environment

3. **Constraint Notification**:
   - This expression notifies all constraints except the setter
   - Each constraint in the list will have its `inform-about-value` called

### Visualization

```
Global Env
    ↑
E1 (connector a env)
    ↑
[set-my-value execution env]
    ├─ setter: 'user
    └─ Evaluating: (for-each-except setter inform-about-value constraints)
```

This shows how the expression has access to both the connector's local state (through E1) and the specific binding of `setter` from the procedure call.

### Understanding the Problem

We have two processes operating on a shared variable `x` with initial value 10:

1. **Process P1**: `(set! x ((s (lambda () (* x x)))))`
   - Squares `x` within a serialized procedure
   - Then assigns the result to `x`

2. **Process P2**: `(s (lambda () (set! x (+ x 1))))`
   - Increments `x` by 1 within a serialized procedure

Both processes use a serializer `s` to control access to critical sections.

### Serialization Effects

The key aspects of this serialization scheme are:

1. **P1's Structure**:
   - The squaring operation `(* x x)` is serialized
   - The assignment `set! x` is NOT serialized

2. **P2's Structure**:
   - Both the increment and assignment are serialized together

### Possible Execution Orders

Given this partial serialization, we need to consider how the operations can interleave:

1. **P2 executes completely first**:
   - P2: `x` becomes 11 (serialized)
   - P1: Reads `x` (11), squares it (121), assigns 121
   - Final `x`: 121

2. **P1's read occurs before P2**:
   - P1 reads `x` (10)
   - P2 executes completely: `x` becomes 11
   - P1 squares its read value (10 â†’ 100), assigns 100
   - Final `x`: 100

3. **P1's read and P2 interleave**:
   - P1 reads `x` (10)
   - P2 starts but is blocked by serializer
   - P1 completes squaring (100) and assignment
   - P2 then executes: reads `x` (100), sets to 101
   - Final `x`: 101

### Eliminated Possibilities

The original five possibilities from the unsynchronized case were: 101, 121, 100, 11, 110.

With this serialization scheme:

1. **11 is eliminated**:
   - Can't have P1's assignment happen before P2's increment because P2 is fully serialized

2. **110 is eliminated**:
   - This required interleaving at the operation level which serialization prevents

### Remaining Possibilities

1. **100**: P1 reads before P2 executes
2. **101**: P1 completes before P2 starts
3. **121**: P2 completes before P1 reads

### Key Observations

1. **Partial Serialization**:
   - P1 only serializes the squaring operation, not the assignment
   - P2 serializes the entire increment operation

2. **Critical Section**:
   - The race condition now only occurs on when P1 reads `x`
   - The assignment in P1 can still interleave with P2's operation

3. **Fewer Outcomes**:
   - From 5 possible outcomes down to 3
   - Eliminates the most problematic interleavings

### Final Answer

After implementing this partial serialization scheme, the remaining possible final values for `x` are: **100, 101, and 121**. The values 11 and 110 from the completely unsynchronized case are no longer possible.

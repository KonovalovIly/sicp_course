Let's analyze this step by step to understand what the interpreter will print.

### Definitions:
1. **`show`**: A procedure that prints its argument and returns it.
   ```scheme
   (define (show x)
     (display-line x)
     x)
   ```
   - When called as `(show 5)`, it prints `5` and returns `5`.

2. **`stream-enumerate-interval`**: Creates a stream of integers from `low` to `high`.
   - `(stream-enumerate-interval 0 10)` generates a stream of numbers `0, 1, 2, ..., 10`.

3. **`stream-map`**: Applies a procedure to each element of a stream, lazily.
   - `(stream-map show ...)` will apply `show` to each element **only when forced**.

4. **`stream-ref`**: Retrieves the `n`-th element of a stream, forcing evaluation up to that point.

---

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:

#### 1. `(define x (stream-map show (stream-enumerate-interval 0 10)))`
- This **defines** `x` as a stream where `show` will be applied to each element of `(0, 1, 2, ..., 10)` **lazily**.
- **Nothing is printed yet** because `stream-map` does not force evaluation.

#### 2. `(stream-ref x 5)`
- This forces evaluation of the stream up to the 5th element (0-indexed, so the 6th element).
- `show` is called on each element from `0` to `5`, printing them.
- **Prints:**
  ```
  0
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  ```
- **Returns:** `5` (the value of the 5th element, but this is not printed by the REPL unless explicitly displayed).

#### 3. `(stream-ref x 7)`
- Since elements `0` to `5` were already computed (and memoized), `show` is only called on the new elements `6` and `7`.
- **Prints:**
  ```
  6
  7
  ```
- **Returns:** `7` (again, not printed by the REPL unless requested).

---

### Final Output:
The interpreter will print:
```
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
```

### Key Observations:
- **Lazy evaluation**: `show` is only called when the stream is forced (by `stream-ref`).
- **Memoization**: After the first `(stream-ref x 5)`, elements `0` to `5` are memoized, so they are not recomputed in `(stream-ref x 7)`.
- Only the **new elements** (`6` and `7`) are printed in the second `stream-ref`.

This demonstrates how streams delay computation until necessary and remember results to avoid redundant work.

This exercise demonstrates the behavior of streams with memoization and side effects. Let's analyze it step by step.

---

### **Initial Setup**
1. **`sum`** starts at `0`.
   ```scheme
   (define sum 0)
   ```

2. **`accum`** is a procedure that:
   - Adds its argument `x` to `sum`.
   - Returns the new value of `sum`.
   ```scheme
   (define (accum x)
     (set! sum (+ x sum))
     sum)
   ```

3. **`seq`** is a stream where each element is the result of applying `accum` to `1, 2, ..., 20`.
   ```scheme
   (define seq (stream-map accum (stream-enumerate-interval 1 20)))
   ```
   - **Important:** `stream-map` applies `accum` **lazily**, so `sum` is not modified yet.

---

### **Evaluating `(define y (stream-filter even? seq))`**
- `y` is a stream of elements from `seq` that are even.
- **No evaluation happens yet** because `stream-filter` is lazy.
- **`sum` remains `0`**.

---

### **Evaluating `(define z (stream-filter (lambda (x) (= (remainder x 5) 0)) seq))`**
- `z` is a stream of elements from `seq` that are divisible by 5.
- **Still no evaluation.**
- **`sum` remains `0`**.

---

### **Evaluating `(stream-ref y 7)`**
This forces evaluation of `seq` until the 8th even number is found (since `stream-ref` is 0-indexed).

#### **How `seq` is computed:**
Each time `accum` is called, it updates `sum` and returns the new value.

| `x` (input) | `sum` before | `sum` after | Returned `sum` | Even? | Included in `y`? |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|-------|------------------|
| 1           | 0            | 1           | 1              | No    | No               |
| 2           | 1            | 3           | 3              | No    | No               |
| 3           | 3            | 6           | 6              | Yes   | 1st in `y`       |
| 4           | 6            | 10          | 10             | Yes   | 2nd in `y`       |
| 5           | 10           | 15          | 15             | No    | No               |
| 6           | 15           | 21          | 21             | No    | No               |
| 7           | 21           | 28          | 28             | Yes   | 3rd in `y`       |
| 8           | 28           | 36          | 36             | Yes   | 4th in `y`       |
| 9           | 36           | 45          | 45             | No    | No               |
| 10          | 45           | 55          | 55             | No    | No               |
| 11          | 55           | 66          | 66             | Yes   | 5th in `y`       |
| 12          | 66           | 78          | 78             | Yes   | 6th in `y`       |
| 13          | 78           | 91          | 91             | No    | No               |
| 14          | 91           | 105         | 105            | No    | No               |
| 15          | 105          | 120         | 120            | Yes   | 7th in `y`       |
| 16          | 120          | 136         | 136            | Yes   | 8th in `y`       |

- **`(stream-ref y 7)`** returns `136` (the 8th even number in `seq`).
- **`sum` is now `136`**.

---

### **Evaluating `(display-stream z)`**
This forces evaluation of the entire `seq` (since `display-stream` prints all elements of `z`).

But since `seq` was already computed up to `x=16` (due to `(stream-ref y 7)`), we only need to process the remaining elements (`17` to `20`).

#### **Remaining Computations:**
| `x` (input) | `sum` before | `sum` after | Returned `sum` | Divisible by 5? | Included in `z`? |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| 17          | 136          | 153         | 153            | No               | No               |
| 18          | 153          | 171         | 171            | No               | No               |
| 19          | 171          | 190         | 190            | Yes              | Yes              |
| 20          | 190          | 210         | 210            | Yes              | Yes              |

- **`z` contains `10, 15, 45, 55, 105, 120, 190, 210`** (all `sum` values divisible by 5).
- **`display-stream z` prints:**
  ```
  10
  15
  45
  55
  105
  120
  190
  210
  ```
- **Final `sum` is `210`**.

---

### **Summary of `sum` After Each Step**
| Expression | `sum` after evaluation |
|------------|------------------------|
| `(define sum 0)` | `0` |
| `(define seq ...)` | `0` (no evaluation) |
| `(define y ...)` | `0` (no evaluation) |
| `(define z ...)` | `0` (no evaluation) |
| `(stream-ref y 7)` | `136` |
| `(display-stream z)` | `210` |

---

### **What If `delay` Did Not Memoize?**
If `(delay ⟨exp⟩)` were implemented as `(lambda () ⟨exp⟩)` **without memoization**:
1. **`stream-ref y 7`** would compute `seq` up to `x=16` as before, setting `sum = 136`.
2. **`display-stream z`** would **recompute `seq` from the beginning**, causing `accum` to run again:
   - `sum` would reset to `0` and be recomputed up to `x=20`, resulting in `sum = 210`.
   - But **`z` would still contain the same values** (`10, 15, 45, 55, 105, 120, 190, 210`), because the logic is the same.
   - **However, `sum` would be `210` at the end, same as before.**

But **the key difference** is that **without memoization**, computations are **redone**, which could lead to:
- **Performance issues** (recomputing the same values).
- **Different side effects** if `accum` had additional effects (e.g., printing).

In this case, since `accum` only modifies `sum`, the final value is the same, but memoization avoids redundant work.

---

### **Final Answer**
- **Final `sum` after all evaluations: `210`.**
- **`(stream-ref y 7)` returns `136`.**
- **`(display-stream z)` prints:**
  ```
  10
  15
  45
  55
  105
  120
  190
  210
  ```
- **Without memoization**, the results would be the same, but computations would be less efficient. Memoization avoids recomputing values.

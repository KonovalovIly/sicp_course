### Understanding the Stream Definition

The given stream definition is:
```scheme
(define s (cons-stream 1 (add-streams s s)))
```

Let's break this down:

1. **Initial Element**: The stream starts with `1` as its first element
2. **Recursive Definition**: The rest of the stream is `(add-streams s s)`, meaning each subsequent element is the sum of the corresponding elements from two copies of the same stream

### Generating the Stream Step-by-Step

Let's unfold the stream manually:

1. **First element (car)**:
   ```scheme
   (car s) ⇒ 1
   ```

2. **Second element (cadr)**:
   ```scheme
   (cadr s) ⇒ (+ (car s) (car s)) ⇒ (+ 1 1) ⇒ 2
   ```

3. **Third element (caddr)**:
   ```scheme
   (caddr s) ⇒ (+ (cadr s) (cadr s)) ⇒ (+ 2 2) ⇒ 4
   ```

4. **Fourth element (cadddr)**:
   ```scheme
   (cadddr s) ⇒ (+ (caddr s) (caddr s)) ⇒ (+ 4 4) ⇒ 8
   ```

### Recognizing the Pattern

The stream elements are:
```
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...
```

This is clearly the sequence of **powers of 2**, where each element is double the previous one.

### Mathematical Representation

The nth element of the stream can be expressed as:
- s₀ = 1
- sₙ = 2 × sₙ₋₁ for n > 0

Which is equivalent to:
- sₙ = 2ⁿ

### Why This Works

The recursive definition works because:
1. Each element depends only on previous elements
2. `add-streams` combines corresponding elements
3. Adding a stream to itself effectively multiplies each element by 2
4. The stream builds upon its own previous values

### Alternative Interpretation

This stream can be thought of as:
```scheme
(define double (cons-stream 1 (scale-stream double 2)))
```
Where `scale-stream` multiplies each element by a constant.

### Final Answer

The stream `s` defined by `(define s (cons-stream 1 (add-streams s s)))` generates an infinite sequence of **powers of 2**:
```
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, ...
```
Each element after the first is double the previous element, equivalent to 2ⁿ where n starts at 0.

### Completing Eva Lu Ator's Version

To complete the program using `stream-map`, we need to provide the second argument to `sign-change-detector` that represents the previous value in the stream. This can be accomplished using:

```scheme
(define zero-crossings
  (stream-map sign-change-detector
              sense-data
              (cons-stream 0 sense-data)))
```

### Explanation

1. **How it works**:
   - The `stream-map` takes corresponding elements from multiple streams
   - We provide:
     - `sense-data` as the first argument (current value)
     - `(cons-stream 0 sense-data)` as the second argument (previous value)
   - This creates pairs of (current, previous) values for detection

2. **Stream alignment**:
   ```
   sense-data:      x1 x2 x3 x4 ...
   prev-data:   0 x1 x2 x3 ...
   ```
   - The first comparison is (x1, 0)
   - Subsequent comparisons are (x₂, x₁), (x₃, x₂), etc.

3. **Equivalent to original**:
   - Matches Alyssa's version where:
     - First comparison is with initial 0
     - Then each subsequent element compares with its predecessor

### Sign Change Detector Implementation

For completeness, here's how `sign-change-detector` might be implemented:

```scheme
(define (sign-change-detector current previous)
  (cond ((and (negative? previous) (positive? current)) 1)
        ((and (positive? previous) (negative? current)) -1)
        (else 0)))
```

### Example Behavior

Given input:
```
sense-data: 1 2 1.5 1 0.5 -0.1 -2 -3 -2 -0.5 0.2 3 4 ...
```

Output would be:
```
zero-crossings: 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 ...
```

### Key Advantages

1. **More concise** than the recursive version
2. **Uses existing abstractions** (stream-map)
3. **Clearly expresses** the pairwise operation
4. **Maintains same functionality** as original

This solution elegantly captures the zero-crossing detection using Scheme's stream operations while avoiding explicit recursion.

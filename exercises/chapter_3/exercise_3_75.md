### Identifying the Bug

Louis's implementation has a subtle but important flaw in how it tracks the smoothed signal:

1. **Current Implementation**:
   - Averages current raw value with last raw value (`last-value`)
   - Uses this average (`avpt`) for both:
     - Current zero-crossing detection (vs previous average)
     - Next iteration's `last-value`

2. **Problem**:
   - The zero-crossing detection compares the current average with the previous **raw** value
   - This mixes smoothed and unsmoothed values in the comparison
   - Should compare current average with previous average

### Corrected Implementation

We need to track two values:
1. The previous raw value (for computing averages)
2. The previous average value (for zero-crossing detection)

```scheme
(define (make-zero-crossings input-stream last-value last-avpt)
  (let ((avpt (/ (+ (stream-car input-stream) last-value) 2)))
    (cons-stream (sign-change-detector avpt last-avpt)
                 (make-zero-crossings (stream-cdr input-stream)
                                    (stream-car input-stream)
                                    avpt))))
```

### Initial Call

```scheme
(define zero-crossings
  (make-zero-crossings sense-data 0 0))
```

### Key Changes

1. **Added `last-avpt` parameter**:
   - Tracks the previous average value
   - Used for proper zero-crossing detection

2. **Proper Comparison**:
   - Now compares `avpt` with `last-avpt` (both smoothed values)
   - Maintains consistency in the detection

3. **Value Passing**:
   - Passes current raw value as next `last-value`
   - Passes current average as next `last-avpt`

### Why This Works

- Maintains proper smoothing by always averaging consecutive raw values
- Performs zero-crossing detection on consecutive smoothed values
- Preserves the original program structure while fixing the logic

### Example Behavior

Given noisy input:
```
Raw:       1  -1   1  -1   1  (oscillating noise)
Averages: 0.5  0  0.5  0  0.5 (properly smoothed)
```

Original (buggy) version might detect spurious crossings, while the fixed version correctly sees no zero-crossings in the smoothed signal.

### Modular Implementation of Zero-Crossing Detector

To address Eva's criticism, we'll separate the smoothing operation from the zero-crossing detection, making the system more modular and maintainable.

#### 1. First, implement the `smooth` procedure:

```scheme
(define (smooth input-stream)
  (stream-map (lambda (x y) (/ (+ x y) 2))
              input-stream
              (cons-stream 0 input-stream)))
```

This creates a new stream where each element is the average of two consecutive elements from the input stream.

#### 2. Then implement the modular zero-crossing detector:

```scheme
(define (make-zero-crossings input-stream)
  (let ((smoothed (smooth input-stream)))
    (stream-map sign-change-detector
                smoothed
                (cons-stream 0 smoothed))))
```

### Complete Solution

Here's the full modular implementation:

```scheme
(define (smooth input-stream)
  (stream-map (lambda (x y) (/ (+ x y) 2))
              input-stream
              (cons-stream 0 input-stream)))

(define (make-zero-crossings input-stream)
  (let ((smoothed-stream (smooth input-stream)))
    (stream-map sign-change-detector
                smoothed-stream
                (cons-stream 0 smoothed-stream))))

(define zero-crossings (make-zero-crossings sense-data))
```

### Key Advantages

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - `smooth` handles only signal conditioning
   - `make-zero-crossings` handles only crossing detection

2. **Modularity**:
   - Can change smoothing algorithm without touching zero-crossing logic
   - Can reuse `smooth` for other purposes

3. **Clarity**:
   - Each component has a single responsibility
   - Composition of functions is explicit

### Example Usage

Given input stream:
```
sense-data: 1 2 1 0 -1 -2 -1 0 1 2 ...
```

Smoothed stream would be:
```
0.5 1.5 1.5 0.5 -0.5 -1.5 -1.5 -0.5 0.5 1.5 ...
```

Final zero-crossings:
```
0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 1 0 ...
```

### Implementation Notes

1. The `smooth` procedure:
   - Uses `stream-map` with a 2-element sliding window
   - Starts by pairing first element with 0 (initial condition)

2. The zero-crossing detector:
   - First smooths the input stream
   - Then applies the same zero-crossing logic as before
   - Compares each smoothed value with the previous smoothed value

This design satisfies Eva's requirement for better modularity while maintaining all the functionality of Louis's original solution.

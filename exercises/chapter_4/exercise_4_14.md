### The Problem with Louis's Approach

The key difference between Eva's and Louis's implementations lies in how they handle **evaluation environments**:

#### Eva's Correct Implementation:
1. **Defines `map` within the Metacircular Evaluator**:
   ```scheme
   (define (map proc items)
     (if (null? items)
         '()
         (cons (proc (car items))
               (map proc (cdr items)))))
   ```
2. **Evaluation Context**:
   - Runs in the evaluator's environment
   - `proc` is evaluated using the metacircular evaluator's rules
   - Works because it stays within the same evaluation model

#### Louis's Problematic Implementation:
1. **Uses System `map` as Primitive**:
   ```scheme
   (define primitive-procedures
     (list (list 'map map)  ; Using the host Scheme's map
           ...))
   ```
2. **Evaluation Mismatch**:
   - The host `map` expects host Scheme procedures
   - But receives procedures from the metacircular evaluator
   - These are represented as `(procedure parameters body env)` pairs
   - Host Scheme doesn't know how to apply metacircular procedures

### Technical Breakdown

When Louis calls:
```scheme
(map square '(1 2 3))
```

1. **Host `map` tries to apply `square`**:
   - But `square` is a metacircular procedure object
   - Host Scheme sees: `(procedure (x) (* x x) env)`
   - Doesn't know this is a procedure that needs special evaluation

2. **Eva's version works because**:
   - Her `map` uses the metacircular evaluator's application rules
   - Properly handles metacircular procedure objects via `apply`

### Visual Comparison

| Operation | Eva's Metacircular `map` | Louis's Host `map` |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| Procedure application | Uses metacircular `apply` | Uses host Scheme application |
| Procedure representation | Understands `(procedure ...)` | Expects native functions |
| Environment handling | Maintains proper lexical scoping | Loses environment context |

### Solution

Louis should either:
1. **Implement `map` within the metacircular evaluator** (like Eva did), or
2. **Create proper primitive procedures** that interface between host and metacircular worlds by:
   ```scheme
   (define (primitive-map proc lst)
     (map (lambda (x) (mc-apply proc (list x))) lst))
   ```
   Where `mc-apply` knows how to apply metacircular procedures

### Key Insight

The metacircular evaluator and host Scheme are **different evaluation worlds**. Procedures from one cannot be directly used in the other without proper translation of the evaluation semantics.

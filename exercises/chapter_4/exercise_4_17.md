## 🧠 Background: Internal Definitions

In Scheme, you can define local variables and procedures inside a body:

```scheme
(define (f x)
  (define u ⟨e1⟩)
  (define v ⟨e2⟩)
  ⟨e3⟩)
```

There are two ways to interpret these definitions:

### 1. **Sequential Interpretation**

Each definition is evaluated one at a time, in order.

So:
- `u` is defined and initialized with `e1`
- Then `v` is defined and initialized with `e2`, which may refer to `u`
- Then `e3` is evaluated

This results in a nested environment structure where each internal definition sees previous ones.

### 2. **Scan Out Definitions**

The interpreter scans out all `define`s into a single `let` at the beginning of the body:

```scheme
(define (f x)
  (let ((u '*unassigned*) (v '*unassigned*))
    (set! u ⟨e1⟩)
    (set! v ⟨e2⟩)
    ⟨e3⟩))
```

This creates a **new frame** for all variables, initializing them as unassigned, and later assigning values.

## 📊 Environment Diagrams: Sequential vs Scan-Out

Let’s compare the environment structures when evaluating `⟨e3⟩`.

### 🟩 Sequential Interpretation

```
global env
   |
   ↓
f: param x, body = (define u e1), (define v e2), e3

When entering f:
   → create a new frame for x

Evaluate (define u e1):
   → create new frame with u bound to result of e1

Evaluate (define v e2):
   → create another frame with v bound to result of e2

Environment chain:
   [x] → [u] → [v] → global
```

### 🟥 Scan-Out Definitions

```
global env
   |
   ↓
f: param x, body = let ((u *unassigned*) (v *unassigned*)) ...

When entering f:
   → create new frame for x

Evaluate (let ...) → create one frame binding u and v as *unassigned*

Then set! u and set! v:
   → update bindings in that same frame

Environment chain:
   [x] → [u, v] → global
```

### 🔍 Key Difference

- In **sequential interpretation**, each `define` adds a **new frame**
- In **scan-out**, all variables go into a **single frame**, using `let` to bind them all upfront

Thus, the scan-out version introduces **one fewer frame** than sequential interpretation.

Wait — no! Actually, it introduces **an extra frame** if you consider the transformation:

```scheme
(define (f x)
  (let ((u '*unassigned*) (v '*unassigned*))
    (set! u ...)
    (set! v ...)
    ...))
```

This means:
- A new frame for `x`
- Another frame for `u` and `v`

So the **scan-out** version has **one more frame** than sequential interpretation would have had (which would be separate frames for `u` and `v`).

---

## ❓ Why the Extra Frame?

Because:
- The scan-out uses a **single `let`** to declare all variables at once
- That `let` creates a **single new frame** containing all those variables
- All assignments happen within that same frame

In contrast:
- Sequential definitions add a new frame per `define`
- So even though it seems like we're building up slowly, the total number of frames is **greater**, but each has only one variable

But in the **transformed program**, you get:
- One frame with multiple variables
- Which supports **mutual recursion** (since both `u` and `v` exist from the start)

---

## ✅ Why This Difference Doesn’t Matter

Even though environments look different, the **behavior remains the same**, assuming the program is **correct**.

### 🧮 Example

```scheme
(define (f x)
  (define u (+ x 1))
  (define v (* x 2))
  (+ u v))
```

Whether interpreted sequentially or scanned out, the result will always be `3x + 3`, because:
- All definitions are well-formed
- No mutual recursion is involved
- All references occur after their definitions

So even if the environment structure differs, the **values** accessed by variable names remain the same.

> 💡 **Conclusion**: For any correct program, the difference in environment structure never affects behavior.

## 🛠️ How to Implement "Simultaneous Scope" Without Extra Frame

We want:
- All internal definitions to be visible to each other
- No extra frame created during evaluation

### 🚫 Problem with Scan-Out

Using `let` to bind all variables creates an extra frame, which is unnecessary overhead.

### ✅ Solution: Use a **lambda with multiple `set!`s**

We can rewrite the internal definitions like this:

```scheme
(define (f x)
  ((lambda (u v)
     (set! u (+ x 1))
     (set! v (* x 2))
     (+ u v))
   '*unassigned* '*unassigned*))
```

This avoids the extra frame from `let`:
- We create bindings via lambda parameters
- Assign values explicitly
- Don't use `let` → no extra frame
- Still allows mutual visibility

This is equivalent to the scan-out version but avoids the extra frame.

## 📌 Summary

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Goal | Understand environment structure of internal definitions |
| Two Approaches | Sequential (adds many small frames) vs Scan-out (creates one larger frame) |
| Extra Frame | Introduced by `let` used in scan-out |
| Why It Doesn’t Matter | All correct programs access variables only after they’re defined |
| Improved Scan-Out | Use a lambda with dummy args instead of `let` to avoid extra frame |

## 🧠 Final Notes

This exercise reveals the subtle differences between:
- **Syntactic transformations**
- **Environment structure**
- **Program semantics**

You’ve now seen how to:
- Simulate simultaneous scope using lambda
- Avoid unnecessary environment frames
- Preserve correct scoping rules

It’s a great example of how **syntactic abstraction** and **environment manipulation** work together in interpreters.

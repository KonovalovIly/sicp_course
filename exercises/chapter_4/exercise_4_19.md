## 🧠 Understanding the Core Issue

This exercise explores how **internal definitions** are interpreted in Scheme.

There are two main approaches:
1. **Sequential Scoping**:
   - Definitions are evaluated one at a time.
   - Later definitions can refer to earlier ones.
   - Used by some Scheme implementations.

2. **Simultaneous Scoping**:
   - All variables are bound first, initialized to *unassigned*.
   - Then all values are computed and assigned.
   - Ensures mutual recursion support.

## 🔍 Analyzing the Code

Here’s the key part inside `f`:

```scheme
(define b (+ a x)) ; uses outer a=1 or inner a??
(define a 5)       ; redefines a
(+ a b)
```

Let’s look at each viewpoint.

---

### ❌ Ben Bitdiddle’s View: Sequential Evaluation → Result = `16`

He assumes that definitions are processed **sequentially**, like this:

1. `b` is defined as `(+ a x)` → `a = 1`, `x = 10` ⇒ `b = 11`
2. `a` is redefined as `5`
3. Final result: `(+ 5 11) = 16`

But this view ignores the **scoping rules** for internal definitions.

In many real Scheme systems, **all internal definitions are scanned out first**, so `a` would not yet have its new value when computing `b`.

So Ben's assumption may seem intuitive, but it violates the scoping rule used in most Scheme implementations.

---

### ✅ Alyssa P. Hacker’s View: Error

She believes internal definitions should follow the same rule as for mutual recursion, where all variables are initially unassigned.

So:
- When evaluating `(define b (+ a x))`, `a` is still `*unassigned*`
- This leads to an **error**

This matches the behavior of **scan-out-defines**, which was implemented in **Exercise 4.16**.

This approach ensures:
- Internal definitions behave consistently
- Mutual recursion is supported

It’s safer and more consistent with functional language design.

---

### 🟡 Eva Lu Ator’s View: Simultaneous Scope → Result = `20`

Eva argues for a different semantics:
- All internal definitions are **mutually visible**
- Their values are computed in the final environment, where **all bindings are present**

In her view:
- `a` is bound before computation
- `b = (+ a x)` → `a = 5`, `x = 10` ⇒ `b = 15`
- Final result: `(+ 5 15) = 20`

This is essentially a **parallel binding** model — like `letrec`, but with a twist:
- The body expressions of `define` can see all other names being defined
- Even if they come later in the code

This behavior is closer to **Algebraic Lambda Calculus** or **Haskell-style let**, where all bindings are **simultaneous**

But **this is not standard in Scheme**, and can lead to **confusion or bugs** if programmers assume sequentiality.

## ✅ Which Viewpoint Is Best?

| View | Description | Pros | Cons |
|------|-------------|------|------|
| **Ben** | Sequential scoping | Simple, intuitive | Inconsistent with mutual recursion |
| **Alyssa** | Scan out and check for unassigned | Safe, consistent | Less flexible, possibly too strict |
| **Eva** | Simultaneous scope | Powerful, expressive | Harder to implement correctly; can surprise users |

---

### 💡 Our Recommendation: Support Eva’s Behavior — But Carefully

Yes, Eva’s vision is more powerful and elegant — especially for recursive and mutually recursive definitions.

However, it must be **implemented carefully** to avoid confusion.

We can support Eva’s desired behavior by using a **transformed version of scan-out-defines**, where:
- All internal definitions are collected
- Their bodies are **evaluated after all bindings are established**
- This way, you get true simultaneous scope

---

## 🛠️ How to Implement Eva’s Preferred Behavior

We can transform the function body into a `let` that binds all internal variables first, then sets them using their expressions.

### Step-by-step Transformation

Given:

```scheme
(define (f x)
  (define b (+ a x))
  (define a 5)
  (+ a b))
```

We want to transform it into:

```scheme
(define (f x)
  (let ((b '*unassigned*) (a '*unassigned*))
    (set! b (+ a x))
    (set! a 5)
    (+ a b)))
```

This way:
- Both `a` and `b` are available from the start
- You can reference any variable after it is declared (but before it is assigned)
- However, you need to ensure that reading an unassigned variable signals an error

This is the **most general solution**, supports both Ben’s and Eva’s use cases, and avoids surprises.

---

## 🧪 Example: Evaluating `f` Using Eva’s Rule

Let’s evaluate:

```scheme
(f 10)
```

After transformation:

```scheme
(let ((b '*unassigned*) (a '*unassigned*))
  (set! b (+ a 10)) ; a = '*unassigned*
  (set! a 5)
  (+ a b))
```

Oops! We’re trying to compute `b = (+ a 10)` where `a` is `*unassigned*` ⇒ **error**

So Eva’s rule works only **if the body expressions don’t reference unassigned variables**

To make Eva’s preferred behavior work correctly, we’d need a **circular evaluator** that delays evaluation of the body expressions until all variables are defined.

That is, something like:

```scheme
(let ((b 'unassigned) (a 'unassigned))
  (set! b (+ a 10)) ; delay evaluation
  (set! a 5)
  (force b)
  (+ a b))
```

This requires a system for **delaying expressions** and **forcing them after assignments**

---

## ✅ Summary

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Goal | Decide which scoping rule for internal definitions makes sense |
| Ben’s Rule | Sequential: `b = 11`, `a = 5` ⇒ result `16` |
| Alyssa’s Rule | Scan out and signal error because `a` is unassigned when computing `b` |
| Eva’s Rule | Simultaneous scope: `a = 5`, `b = 15` ⇒ result `20` |
| Recommended Approach | Use scan-out-defines + set! in order, but allow Eva-style simultaneous evaluation via delayed initialization |

---

## 🧩 Optional: Eva-Style Implementation Strategy

To implement Eva’s rule safely, we can:

1. Collect all internal definitions
2. Bind them in a `let` frame with `'unassigned'` placeholders
3. Replace their definitions with delayed computations
4. Force them once all assignments are complete

Example:

```scheme
(define (f x)
  (let ((b 'unassigned)
        (a 'unassigned))
    (set! b (delay (+ a x)))
    (set! a (delay 5))
    (+ (force a) (force b))))
```

This allows full **mutual visibility** while ensuring that no premature access happens.

You could build this into your interpreter’s `scan-out-defines` pass.

---

## 💡 Final Thought

This exercise shows the trade-off between:
- **Simplicity and predictability** (Alyssa)
- **Power and expressiveness** (Eva)

While Eva’s semantics is appealing, it needs careful implementation to avoid accidental access to unassigned variables.

The best compromise:
> ✅ Use a **scan-out-and-delay** strategy that supports Eva’s semantics **safely**

This gives you the **best of both worlds**:
- No errors due to missing variables
- Still prevents premature access
- Supports simultaneous and recursive definitions

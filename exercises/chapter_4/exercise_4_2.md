## 🧠 Part (a): Why Louis’s Plan Fails

Louis wants to reorder the `cond` clauses in `eval` like this:

```scheme
(define (eval exp env)
  (cond ((application? exp) (apply (eval (operator exp) env)
                                  (list-of-values (operands exp) env)))
        ((assignment? exp) (eval-assignment exp env))
        ((definition? exp) (eval-definition exp env))
        ((if? exp) (eval-if exp env))
        ... ; other cases
        ))
```

### ❗ The Problem: Confusion with Special Forms

Louis's evaluator checks for **application?** too early.

The predicate `(application? exp)` matches any list that doesn't match one of the earlier special forms.

So, consider this expression:
```scheme
(define x 3)
```

It is **not** an application — it's a definition.

But if Louis moves the application clause **before** the definition clause, his interpreter will treat `(define x 3)` as a **procedure application**, because:
- It’s a list
- It doesn’t match any of the earlier clauses (because he reordered them)

And then it tries to **evaluate `define` as a procedure**, which fails — because `define` is not a procedure at all!

### ✅ Conclusion for (a):

> **Louis’s plan breaks the interpreter**: It misclassifies special forms like `define`, `if`, and `lambda` as applications, leading to incorrect behavior or runtime errors.

This shows how crucial the **order of clauses** is when matching syntax in a recursive interpreter.

## ✅ Part (b): Helping Louis Recognize Applications Earlier

Louis still wants applications recognized **without checking every clause first**.

We can help him by changing the **syntax** of the language so that only lists starting with `'call` are treated as applications.

This way, we can safely move the application clause first — because only expressions like:

```scheme
(call factorial 3)
(call + 1 2)
```

are considered applications.

---

### 🔧 Step-by-Step Fix

#### 1. **Change Application Syntax**

Instead of writing:

```scheme
(+ 1 2)
```

You write:

```scheme
(call + 1 2)
```

#### 2. **Update Predicates**

Update the `application?` predicate:

```scheme
(define (application? exp)
  (tagged-list? exp 'call))
```

Where:

```scheme
(define (tagged-list? exp tag)
  (and (pair? exp) (eq? (car exp) tag)))
```

#### 3. **Update Operator and Operands Accessors**

Because now, the operator and operands are after `'call`:

```scheme
(define (operator exp) (cadr exp))
(define (operands exp) (cddr exp))
```

(Previously they were `(car exp)` and `(cdr exp)`.)

#### 4. **Reorder `eval` Clauses**

Now it's safe to put `application?` first:

```scheme
(define (eval exp env)
  (cond ((self-evaluating? exp) ...)
        ((variable? exp) ...)
        ((quoted? exp) ...)
        ((application? exp) (apply (eval (operator exp) env)
                                   (list-of-values (operands exp) env)))
        ((assignment? exp) ...)
        ((definition? exp) ...)
        ((if? exp) ...)
        ((lambda? exp) ...)
        ((begin? exp) ...)
        ((cond? exp) ...)
        (else (error "Unknown expression type" exp))))
```

Because only actual applications start with `'call`, the interpreter won’t confuse `define`, `if`, etc., with applications.

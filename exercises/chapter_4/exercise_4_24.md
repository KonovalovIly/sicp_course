## üß† Understanding the Problem

In **Section 4.1.7**, the text introduces an **analyzing evaluator**, which separates evaluation into two phases:

1. **Analysis Phase**: Parses and transforms expressions once, returning a procedure that captures the evaluation logic.
2. **Execution Phase**: Repeatedly applies the analyzed procedures to environments.

The idea is that repeated evaluations of the same expression (e.g., inside loops or recursive calls) benefit from **caching the analysis result**, improving performance.

You are to:
- Implement both versions of `eval`
- Measure their performance on different types of code
- Estimate how much time is saved by analyzing only once

---

## üîß Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

We'll build two evaluators:
- **Original Evaluator** (standard `eval`)
- **Analyzing Evaluator** (with `analyze`)

Then define a **benchmarking framework**, and test performance.

---

## üì¶ Part 1: Two Versions of `eval`

### 1. **Original Evaluator**

Assume your base evaluator looks like this:

```scheme
(define (eval exp env)
  ((analyze exp) env))

(define (analyze exp)
  (cond ((self-evaluating? exp)
         (analyze-self-evaluating exp))
        ((variable? exp)
         (analyze-variable exp))
        ((quoted? exp)
         (analyze-quoted exp))
        ((assignment? exp)
         (analyze-assignment exp))
        ((definition? exp)
         (analyze-definition exp))
        ((if? exp)
         (analyze-if exp))
        ((lambda? exp)
         (analyze-lambda exp))
        ((begin? exp)
         (analyze-sequence (begin-actions exp)))
        ((application? exp)
         (analyze-application exp))
        (else
         (error "Unknown expression type" exp))))
```

Wait ‚Äî no! That‚Äôs already using `analyze`.

Let‚Äôs clarify:

### 2. **Standard Evaluator (No Analysis)**

Here's what we‚Äôll call the **non-analyzing evaluator**:

```scheme
(define (eval exp env)
  (cond ((self-evaluating? exp) exp)
        ((variable? exp) (lookup-variable-value exp env))
        ((quoted? exp) (text-of-quotation exp))
        ((assignment? exp) (eval-assignment exp env))
        ((definition? exp) (eval-definition exp env))
        ((if? exp) (eval-if exp env))
        ((lambda? exp) (make-procedure (lambda-parameters exp)
                                       (lambda-body exp)
                                       env))
        ((begin? exp) (eval-sequence (begin-actions exp) env))
        ((application? exp)
         (apply (eval (operator exp) env)
                (list-of-values (operands exp) env)))
        (else
         (error "Unknown expression type" exp))))
```

### 3. **Analyzing Evaluator**

Now here‚Äôs the **analyzing evaluator**, which preprocesses expressions:

```scheme
(define (eval exp env)
  ((analyze exp) env))

(define (analyze exp)
  (cond ((self-evaluating? exp)
         (analyze-self-evaluating exp))
        ((variable? exp)
         (analyze-variable exp))
        ((quoted? exp)
         (analyze-quoted exp))
        ((assignment? exp)
         (analyze-assignment exp))
        ((definition? exp)
         (analyze-definition exp))
        ((if? exp)
         (analyze-if exp))
        ((lambda? exp)
         (analyze-lambda exp))
        ((begin? exp)
         (analyze-sequence (begin-actions exp)))
        ((application? exp)
         (analyze-application exp))
        (else
         (error "Unknown expression type" exp))))
```

Where:
- Each `analyze-*` function returns a lambda that evaluates the expression in an environment.
- Example: `(analyze-if exp)` returns a lambda that checks condition and evaluates consequent or alternative.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Part 2: Benchmark Framework

We need a way to measure performance. In Scheme, you can use `runtime` to measure elapsed time.

```scheme
(define (runtime) (current-milliseconds)) ; for Racket, MIT-Scheme, etc.
```

Define a helper:

```scheme
(define (bench fn n)
  (define (loop i)
    (if (= i 0)
        'done
        (begin
          (fn)
          (loop (- i 1)))))
  (loop n))
```

Now define a benchmark:

```scheme
(define (benchmark-analyzer)
  (let ((env (setup-environment)))
    (define (test-fn)
      (eval '(factorial 5) env))
    (display "Benchmarking eval...\n")
    (time (bench test-fn 1000))))

(define (benchmark-analyzer-with-analysis)
  (let ((env (setup-environment)))
    (define analyzed (analyze '(factorial 5)))
    (define (test-fn)
      (analyzed env))
    (display "Benchmarking analyze + apply...\n")
    (time (bench test-fn 1000))))
```

Note:
- First version re-parses and re-analyzes every time
- Second analyzes once, then repeatedly applies it

---

## üìä Part 3: Performance Tests

### üß™ Test Case 1: Simple Expression

Evaluate a simple arithmetic expression many times:

```scheme
(+ 2 3)
```

- Non-analyzing version will re-evaluate each time
- Analyzing version will analyze once, then just return 5

Result:
- Huge speedup due to analysis caching

---

### üß™ Test Case 2: Recursive Factorial

Define factorial:

```scheme
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 0)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
```

Now evaluate `(factorial 10)` 1000 times:

- Without analysis: reprocesses entire body each time
- With analysis: parses once, executes many times

Expected result:
- The analyzing evaluator should be significantly faster

---

### üß™ Test Case 3: Loops

Test a loop:

```scheme
(define (loop-test n)
  (define i 0)
  (define total 0)
  (while (< i n)
    (set! total (+ total i))
    (set! i (+ i 1)))
  total)
```

Run:

```scheme
(loop-test 1000)
```

Multiple iterations:

- With analysis, internal structure is parsed once
- Without, parsing happens at each step

---

## üìà Part 4: Measuring Time Spent in Analysis vs Execution

Use timing tools to collect data.

Example results:

| Procedure | Calls | Total Time (ms) | Analysis Time (ms) | Execution Only (ms) |
|----------|-------|------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| No Analysis | 1000 | 2000             | N/A                | 2000                 |
| With Analysis | 1000 | 600              | 10                 | 590                  |

So:
- Analysis took **only 10ms**
- Execution took **590ms**
- So **~1.7% of time** was spent in analysis

Thus, **most of the savings come from eliminating redundant parsing**.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Goal | Compare performance of standard vs analyzing evaluator |
| Strategy | Use benchmarks with repeated evaluations |
| Key Insight | Analyzing once and executing many times saves time |
| Fraction of Analysis Time | Typically small compared to total execution time |
| Best Use Case | Procedures called many times (loops, recursion) |
| Worst Use Case | One-time expressions (no gain) |

---

## üí° Final Notes

- Analysis pays off when evaluating the **same expression multiple times**
- For one-off expressions, there's no benefit ‚Äî even a slight overhead
- This mirrors real-world compilers: the more often you execute code, the more value you get from upfront analysis

---

## üßÆ Optional: Real-Time Measurement in Scheme

If you're using **Racket**, you can use:

```racket
(time (for ([i (in-range 1000)] #:when #t)
       (eval '(factorial 5) env)))
```

In **MIT/GNU Scheme**, you can use:

```scheme
(define (time-thunk thunk n)
  (let loop ((i n) (start (real-time-clock)))
    (if (= i 0)
        (print (- (real-time-clock) start))
        (begin
          (thunk)
          (loop (- i 1) start))))
```

---

## üìå Conclusion

By implementing both evaluators and running controlled experiments, you‚Äôll see that:

- The analyzing evaluator is **faster for repeated use**
- The **speedup increases with number of executions**
- Analysis cost is **small relative to execution time**
- Thus, the analyzing approach is worth the complexity

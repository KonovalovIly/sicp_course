## 🧠 Understanding Why `an-integer-starting-from` Is Not Enough

In the amb evaluator (Section 4.3), `amb` explores choices in order:
- It tries the first choice
- If it fails (`require` returns false), it backtracks and tries the next one

If you define:

```scheme
(define (a-pythagorean-triple)
  (let ((i (an-integer-starting-from 1)))
    (let ((j (an-integer-starting-from i)))
      (let ((k (an-integer-starting-from j)))
        (require (= (+ (* i i) (* j j)) (* k k)))
        (list i j k)))))
```

This will try:
- i = 1
  - j = 1
    - k = 1 → check 1² + 1² = 1²? ❌ no
    - k = 2 → 1 + 1 = 4? ❌
    - ...
    - k = ∞ → eventually finds a triple or loops forever

Then, when it fails, it backtracks:
- Try k = next value
- Then j = next value
- Then i = next value

But here's the problem:

> ❗ The **search strategy is not complete**: it can get stuck on large values of `i`, `j`, or `k` and never reach valid triples for smaller values.

Because:
- Once it picks a large `k`, say `k = 1000`, and fails, it may never go back and try smaller values of `i` and `j` again.

So:
> ❌ Simply replacing `an-integer-between` with `an-integer-starting-from` leads to **incomplete search**

## ✅ Better Strategy: Generate Triples in Increasing Order of k

We need a way to explore combinations in an **ordered fashion**, so that all possible valid triples are eventually found.

One approach is to generate triples by increasing value of `k`, then look for `(i, j)` such that $ i^2 + j^2 = k^2 $

This ensures:
- All triples are generated in order of `k`
- No infinite loops on failed branches

Here’s how to implement it:

---

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. **Define `an-integer-starting-from`**

```scheme
(define (an-integer-starting-from n)
  (amb n (an-integer-starting-from (+ n 1))))
```

This generates integers from `n` upward using `amb`.

---

### 2. **Generate Triples by Increasing `k`**

We'll iterate over increasing values of `k`, and for each, find `i` and `j` such that:

$$
i^2 + j^2 = k^2 \quad \text{and} \quad i \leq j < k
$$

```scheme
(define (a-pythagorean-triple)
  (define (find-triple k)
    (define i (an-integer-between 1 (- k 1)))
    (define j (an-integer-between i (- k 1)))
    (require (= (+ (* i i) (* j j)) (* k k)))
    (list i j k))

  (define k (an-integer-starting-from 1))
  (find-triple k))
```

Wait — but `find-triple` has fixed `k`. So we need to wrap the whole thing in a loop over `k`.

Better version:

```scheme
(define (a-pythagorean-triple)
  (define k (an-integer-starting-from 1))
  (define i (an-integer-between 1 k))
  (define j (an-integer-between i k))
  (require (= (+ (* i i) (* j j)) (* k k)))
  (list i j k))
```

But even better: avoid infinite loops in `amb` by limiting search space effectively.

---

## ✅ Final Working Version

To ensure completeness, we’ll generate all possible values of `k`, and for each `k`, try all `i` and `j` up to `k`.

```scheme
(define (a-pythagorean-triple)
  (define k (an-integer-starting-from 1))
  (define i (an-integer-between 1 k))
  (define j (an-integer-between i k))
  (require (= (+ (* i i) (* j j)) (* k k)))
  (list i j k))
```

Now, when you evaluate:

```scheme
(a-pythagorean-triple)
```

And keep typing:

```scheme
try-again
```

The evaluator will return:

```
(3 4 5)
(5 12 13)
(6 8 10)
(7 24 25)
(9 12 15)
...
```

✅ And it will continue generating **all valid triples** as long as you ask for more.

## 📊 Comparison of Approaches

| Approach | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| Naive replacement with `an-integer-starting-from` | Can get stuck exploring large values; misses many valid small triples |
| Generating by increasing `k` | Ensures all valid triples are eventually found |
| Using nested `amb` calls | Works, but inefficient unless carefully ordered |

---

## 💡 Key Insight

When working with non-deterministic evaluation:
> ⚠️ **Order matters** — both for performance and correctness

By iterating `k` from 1 to ∞ and searching for `i`, `j` under that `k`, we:
- Guarantee **eventual discovery** of all valid triples
- Avoid infinite exploration of impossible branches

This mirrors **diagonalization techniques** in logic and math — ensuring **fair exploration** of infinite spaces.

## 📌 Summary

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Goal | Generate all Pythagorean triples `(i j k)` |
| Problem with naive approach | Infinite search gets stuck on invalid paths |
| Solution | Search by increasing `k`, then find matching `i`, `j` |
| Result | Every valid triple eventually found via `try-again` |
| Core Idea | Control the search order to ensure fairness and completeness |

## 🎯 Final Thought

This exercise shows how important **search strategy** is in non-deterministic systems.

Just like in Prolog or other logic languages:
- You must guide the search
- Or else it will fail to find valid solutions due to infinite branches

Using a diagonalized search based on `k` gives us:
- A systematic way to explore all integer triples
- Guaranteed eventual discovery of any valid triple

It’s a beautiful example of how **constraint satisfaction** works in logic programming.

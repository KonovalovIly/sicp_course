## 🧠 Understanding the Original Puzzle

In the original **multiple-dwelling** problem (Section 4.3.2), five people are assigned to different floors in a five-floor building:

```scheme
(define (multiple-dwelling)
  (let ((baker    (amb 1 2 3 4 5))
        (cooper   (amb 1 2 3 4 5))
        (fletcher (amb 1 2 3 4 5))
        (miller   (amb 1 2 3 4 5))
        (smith    (amb 1 2 3 4 5)))
    (require (not (= baker 5)))
    (require (not (= cooper 1)))
    (require (not (= fletcher 1)))
    (require (not (= fletcher 5)))
    (require (> miller cooper))
    (require (not (= (abs (- smith fletcher)) 1))) ; Smith not adjacent to Fletcher
    (require (distinct? (list baker cooper fletcher miller smith)))
    (list (list 'baker baker)
          (list 'cooper cooper)
          (list 'fletcher fletcher)
          (list 'miller miller)
          (list 'smith smith))))
```

The key constraint being removed is:

```scheme
(require (not (= (abs (- smith fletcher)) 1)))
```

This line ensures that **Smith and Fletcher do not live on adjacent floors**

---

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Solution

Let’s modify the procedure by **removing the adjacency constraint** between Smith and Fletcher.

Here's the updated version:

```scheme
(define (multiple-dwelling-modified)
  (let ((baker    (amb 1 2 3 4 5))
        (cooper   (amb 1 2 3 4 5))
        (fletcher (amb 1 2 3 4 5))
        (miller   (amb 1 2 3 4 5))
        (smith    (amb 1 2 3 4 5)))
    (require (not (= baker 5)))
    (require (not (= cooper 1)))
    (require (not (= fletcher 1)))
    (require (not (= fletcher 5)))
    (require (> miller cooper))
    ;; Removed: Smith not adjacent to Fletcher
    (require (distinct? (list baker cooper fletcher miller smith)))
    (list (list 'baker baker)
          (list 'cooper cooper)
          (list 'fletcher fletcher)
          (list 'miller miller)
          (list 'smith smith))))
```

Now run it in an `amb` evaluator.

## 📊 Counting All Valid Solutions

To count all valid configurations, define a helper function:

```scheme
(define (count-solutions proc)
  (define (loop count)
    (let ((result (proc)))
      (if result
          (loop (+ count 1))
          count)))
  (loop 0))
```

Then call:

```scheme
(count-solutions multiple-dwelling-modified)
```

However, since `amb` only returns one solution at a time unless you're using a custom search tool, we need to simulate exhaustive search or use a backtracking strategy.

Alternatively, use nested loops over floor values and count manually.

---

## 🧮 How Many Solutions?

We can compute the number of valid combinations analytically or by simulation.

Let’s look at the constraints again:

### Constraints That Still Apply:
- Baker ≠ 5
- Cooper ≠ 1
- Fletcher ≠ 1, Fletcher ≠ 5
- Miller lives above Cooper → `miller > cooper`
- All five must be distinct

We’ll now calculate how many such combinations satisfy all these constraints.

There are **5! = 120** total permutations of floor assignments.

But many are invalid due to constraints.

Let’s go through the logic:

---

### Step-by-step Counting Strategy

We loop over all possible floor assignments for each person, checking the remaining constraints.

You could write a Scheme program like this:

```scheme
(define (count-multiple-dwelling)
  (define count 0)
  (for-each
   (lambda (baker)
     (for-each
      (lambda (cooper)
        (for-each
         (lambda (fletcher)
           (for-each
            (lambda (miller)
              (for-each
               (lambda (smith)
                 (if (and (distinct? (list baker cooper fletcher miller smith))
                      (not (= baker 5))
                      (not (= cooper 1))
                      (not (= fletcher 1))
                      (not (= fletcher 5))
                      (> miller cooper))
                     (set! count (+ count 1))))
             '(1 2 3 4 5)))
         '(1 2 3 4 5)))
       '(1 2 3 4 5)))
     '(1 2 3 4 5)))
   '(1 2 3 4 5))
  count)
```

Using this or a similar approach, you'll find:

> ✅ There are **4 possibilities** originally.
>
> After removing the Smith-Fletcher adjacency constraint, there are **more solutions**, because some previously excluded cases are now allowed.

From known results:

| Version | Number of Solutions |
|--------|----------------------|
| Original | 1 |
| Modified (no adjacency) | **many more** |

Running the modified code should yield:

> ✅ **There are 5 possible valid assignments** when Smith and Fletcher can live on adjacent floors.

So the removal of that constraint **increases the number of solutions from 1 to 5**

## 📌 Summary

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Goal | Count number of solutions without Smith-Fletcher adjacency constraint |
| Key Change | Remove `(require (not (= (abs (- smith fletcher)) 1)))` |
| Original Constraint | Smith and Fletcher not adjacent |
| Modified Constraint | No adjacency constraint |
| Result | From **1 solution** → **5 solutions**
| Why? | More assignments satisfy the remaining constraints |

## 💡 Final Notes

This exercise shows how **constraint satisfaction** works in non-deterministic programming:
- Each constraint reduces the number of possibilities
- Removing one constraint can dramatically increase the number of valid configurations

It also demonstrates the power of `amb`:
- You don't have to manage the search yourself — just declare constraints
- The interpreter explores all combinations until it finds valid ones

Even though the original puzzle had only **one unique solution**, relaxing one constraint gives us **five** valid arrangements.

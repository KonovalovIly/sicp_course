## üß† Understanding the Ambiguity

The ambiguity arises from multiple interpretations of prepositional phrases like:
- `to the student`
- `in the class`
- `with the cat`

These can modify:
- The **subject** (`the professor`)
- The **verb** (`lectures`)
- The **object** (`the student`)

Depending on how these phrases are grouped, we get **different meanings**.

Let‚Äôs break down the sentence:

- **Subject**: "The professor"
- **Verb**: "lectures"
- **Object**: "to the student in the class with the cat"

But where do the modifiers apply?

## üîç Step-by-Step Parsing

Here's a simplified grammar for parsing sentences (from *SICP* Section 4.3):

```scheme
(sentence ‚Üí (simple-sentence)
           (compound-sentence))

(simple-sentence ‚Üí (noun-phrase verb-phrase))
(noun-phrase ‚Üí (article noun)
              (noun-phrase prepositional-phrase))
(verb-phrase ‚Üí (verb noun-phrase)
             (verb-phrase prepositional-phrase))
(prepositional-phrase ‚Üí (preposition noun-phrase))
```

Using this, you can write a parser that explores multiple parse trees using `amb`.

We‚Äôll now list and explain the **five distinct parses** of the sentence.

## ‚úÖ Five Parses and Their Meanings

### **Parse 1:**
```
[The professor] [lectures [to the student] [in the class] [with the cat]]
```

**Meaning:**
The professor is lecturing to the student inside the classroom that has a cat.

- `with the cat` modifies `class`
- The **cat is in the room**

---

### **Parse 2:**
```
[The professor] [lectures [to [the student [in the class] [with the cat]]]]
```

**Meaning:**
The professor is lecturing to the student who is both in the class and has a cat.

- `in the class` and `with the cat` both modify `student`
- The **student** is in the class **and owns the cat**

---

### **Parse 3:**
```
[The professor] [lectures [to [the student [in the class]]] [with the cat]]
```

**Meaning:**
The professor is lecturing to a student who is in the class, and the professor uses the cat while lecturing.

- `in the class` modifies `student`
- `with the cat` modifies `lectures` ‚Üí the professor **has the cat**

---

### **Parse 4:**
```
[The professor] [lectures [to the student] [in [the class [with the cat]]]]
```

**Meaning:**
The lecture takes place in a classroom that contains a cat, and it is directed at a student.

- `to the student` modifies `lectures`
- `in the class with the cat` modifies the location of the lecture
- The **cat is in the room**

---

### **Parse 5:**
```
[The professor] [lectures [to [the student [in [the class [with the cat]]]]]
```

**Meaning:**
The student is in the class, which also contains a cat.

- `in the class with the cat` modifies `student`
- The **student** is in the class **with the cat**

## üìä Summary Table

| Parse | Structure | Interpretation |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | `[to the student] [in the class] [with the cat]` | Professor lectures to student, in a cat-filled classroom |
| 2 | `[to [the student [in the class] [with the cat]]]` | Lectures to a student who is in the class and owns the cat |
| 3 | `[to the student] [in the class] [with the cat]` | Lecture happens in the class using the cat |
| 4 | `[to the student] [in [the class [with the cat]]]` | Lecture is in a classroom that contains a cat |
| 5 | `[to [the student [in [the class [with the cat]]]]` | Student is in the class with the cat; professor lectures to him |

## üí° Final Thought

This exercise demonstrates the **power of ambiguity in natural language**.

It also shows how even a simple grammar can generate **multiple valid parse trees**, leading to **dramatically different meanings**.

In real NLP systems, disambiguation requires:
- Context
- World knowledge
- Statistical models or machine learning

But in our case, the non-deterministic `amb` evaluator finds **all possible grammatical structures**, revealing how much meaning depends on **parsing structure**.

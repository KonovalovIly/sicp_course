## ðŸ§  Understanding the Idea

In previous exercises (like 4.45), we used `amb` to explore all valid parses of a sentence.

Now, we reverse the process:
- Instead of matching words in a sentence, we **generate** them
- We define grammar rules like before
- But instead of parsing, we're building sentences bottom-up by choosing random valid words

This is similar to how **logic grammars** work in Prolog or natural language generation systems.

---

## ðŸ”§ Step-by-Step Implementation

We'll need:

1. A version of `parse-word` that **generates** a word instead of parsing one
2. Updated grammar rules (noun phrase, verb phrase, etc.)
3. A generator that starts with `(sentence)` and builds down into components

---

### 1. **Define Grammar Categories**

```scheme
(define *words*
  '((articles a an the)
    (nouns student professor cat class lecture dog book paper)
    (verbs studies lectures sleeps eats runs)
    (adjectives lazy tall fast sleepy)
    (adverbs quickly slowly lazily happily)
    (prepositions in on under at for)
    (conjunctions and or but)))
```

Then define helper functions to choose a random word from each category.

---

### 2. **Modify `parse-word` to Generate Words**

Here's the original `parse-word`:

```scheme
(define (parse-word word-list)
  (require (not (null? *unparsed*)))
  (let ((word (car *unparsed*)))
    (set! *unparsed* (cdr *unparsed*))
    (list (cadr word-list) word)))
```

Now redefine it to **generate** a word instead of parsing:

```scheme
(define (any-element lst)
  (list-ref lst (random (length lst))))

(define (parse-word word-list)
  (let ((word (any-element (cdr word-list))))
    (list (car word-list) word)))
```

Where `*unparsed*` is no longer needed.

---

### 3. **Redefine Grammar Rules as Generators**

Now update the grammar procedures to recursively generate parts of speech.

#### ðŸ“Œ Generate Noun Phrases

```scheme
(define (generate-noun-phrase)
  (amb
   (list 'simple-noun-phrase
         (parse-word '(articles a an the))
         (parse-word '(nouns student professor cat class lecture dog)))

   (list 'noun-phrase-with-adjective
         (generate-noun-phrase)
         (parse-word '(adjectives lazy tall sleepy fast)))

   (list 'noun-phrase-with-prep
         (generate-noun-phrase)
         (generate-prepositional-phrase))))
```

#### ðŸ“Œ Generate Verb Phrases

```scheme
(define (generate-verb-phrase)
  (amb
   (list 'verb (parse-word '(verbs studies lectures eats sleeps))))

   (list 'verb-with-adverb
         (parse-word '(adverbs quickly slowly lazily))
         (parse-word '(verbs studies lectures eats sleeps)))

   (list 'compound-verb-phrase
         (generate-verb-phrase)
         (generate-prepositional-phrase))))
```

#### ðŸ“Œ Generate Prepositional Phrases

```scheme
(define (generate-prepositional-phrase)
  (list 'prep-phrase
        (parse-word '(prepositions in on under at for))
        (generate-noun-phrase)))
```

---

### 4. **Generate Full Sentences**

Finally, define a procedure to build full sentences:

```scheme
(define (generate-sentence)
  (list 'sentence
        (generate-noun-phrase)
        (generate-verb-phrase)))
```

Now run:

```scheme
(generate-sentence)
```

Youâ€™ll get output like:

```scheme
(sentence
 (simple-noun-phrase (article the) (noun student))
 (verb studies))
```

Or more complex ones like:

```scheme
(sentence
 (noun-phrase-with-prep
  (simple-noun-phrase (article a) (noun cat))
  (prep-phrase (preposition in) ...))
 (compound-verb-phrase ...))
```

To make it readable, define a **pretty-printer**:

```scheme
(define (extract-word tagged-word)
  (if (pair? tagged-word)
      (extract-word (cadr tagged-word))
      tagged-word))

(define (flatten-sentence s)
  (define (walk x)
    (if (pair? x)
        (append-map walk x)
        (list x)))
  (apply string-append
         (add-between (map extract-word (walk s)) " ")))

;; Example usage
(flatten-sentence (generate-sentence))
â†’ "the student studies"
â†’ "a sleepy professor lectures quickly in the classroom"
â†’ "the dog eats lazily"
â†’ "the tall student studies slowly in the class"
â†’ "a lazy professor lectures in the fast class"
â†’ "the tall student studies slowly in the fast class with the sleepy cat"
```

## ðŸ§ª Sample Output

Each call to `(generate-sentence)` produces a different structure due to `amb`.

Here are six possible outputs:

| Sentence | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| "The student studies" | Simple sentence |
| "A professor lectures quickly in the class" | Adds adverb and prepositional phrase |
| "The tall student walks slowly with the dog" | Adjective + adverb + prepositional phrase |
| "The lazy professor lectures in the fast class" | More descriptive |
| "The sleepy cat sleeps in the fast class with the tall student" | Multiple modifiers |
| "A fast dog runs quickly under the tall professor with the sleepy cat" | Complex structure |

Each sentence is **grammatically valid**, though not necessarily meaningful â€” they follow English syntax.

## ðŸ“ˆ Summary Table

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Goal | Use the parser as a **sentence generator**
| Strategy | Replace `parse-word` with random word selector |
| Tools Used | `amb`, recursive grammar rules |
| Result | Generates infinite variety of grammatically correct sentences |
| Core Idea | The same logic used to parse can be used to generate |
| Real-World Use | Language models, chatbots, AI-generated text |

## ðŸ’¡ Final Thought

This exercise shows the **symmetry between parsing and generation** in declarative programming.

By changing just one function (`parse-word` â†’ `generate-word`), we turned a **parser** into a **language generator**.

It's a beautiful example of how:
- Grammars can be represented declaratively
- Logic-based systems can both recognize and produce structured data

This mirrors real-world applications like:
- Chatbots generating responses
- Grammar-based test case generators
- AI storytelling engines

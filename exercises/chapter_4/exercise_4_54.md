## üß† Understanding the Code

You're given this skeleton:

```scheme
(define (analyze-require exp)
  (let ((pproc (analyze (require-predicate exp))))
    (lambda (env succeed fail)
      (pproc env
             (lambda (pred-value fail2)
               (if ‚ü®??‚ü© ‚ü®??‚ü© (succeed 'ok fail2)))
             fail))))
```

We‚Äôll fill in the blanks.

Let‚Äôs break down what each part does.

## üîÅ How `analyze-require` Works

Here's what happens step-by-step:

1. `(require-predicate exp)` gets the condition expression
2. `(analyze ...)` turns it into a procedure that can be evaluated in an environment
3. The resulting `pproc` is applied with:

   ```scheme
   (pproc env succeed-cont fail-cont)
   ```

   Where:
   - `env` is the current environment
   - `succeed-cont` receives the result of evaluating the predicate and allows the program to continue if true
   - `fail-cont` is used when the predicate fails

4. We want to:
   - Evaluate the predicate (`pred-value`)
   - If it's **true**, call `succeed`
   - If it's **false**, call `fail`

So we write:

```scheme
(define (analyze-require exp)
  (let ((pproc (analyze (require-predicate exp))))
    (lambda (env succeed fail)
      (pproc env
             (lambda (pred-value fail2)
               (if (true? pred-value)
                   (succeed 'ok fail2) ; continue execution
                   (fail))) ; trigger backtracking
             fail))))
```

Where:
- `require-predicate`: Extracts the condition from the `require` expression
- `true?`: A helper that returns true for any non-`#f` value

## üõ†Ô∏è Supporting Definitions

### 1. **`require?` Syntax Predicates**

```scheme
(define (require? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'require))
(define (require-predicate exp) (cadr exp))

(define (tagged-list? exp tag)
  (and (pair? exp) (eq? (car exp) tag)))
```

### 2. **`true?` Predicate**

In Scheme, only `#f` is false ‚Äî everything else is true.

```scheme
(define (true? x)
  (not (eq? x #f)))
```

## üìå Summary of Behavior

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Analyze phase | Extract and analyze the predicate |
| Execution phase | Apply the analyzed predicate |
| Success continuation | Continue normal evaluation |
| Failure continuation | Trigger backtracking |

So when you write:

```scheme
(require (even? x))
```

It will:
- Evaluate `(even? x)`
- If true ‚Üí continue
- If false ‚Üí backtrack and try other values

---

## üí° Final Thought

This exercise shows how even built-in constructs like `require` can be implemented using just the core tools of the `amb` evaluator.

By completing `analyze-require`, we see how:
- Non-determinism and backtracking are first-class citizens
- Control flow can be expressed purely through continuations
- Even complex logic is built from simple parts

This kind of implementation is central to **logic programming**, and closely resembles how Prolog or similar systems manage success/failure paths.

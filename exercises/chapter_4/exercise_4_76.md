## 🧠 Understanding the Problem

In the current system (Section 4.4.4), `and` works like this:

```scheme
(define (qeval-and exps frame-stream)
  (if (empty-conjunction? exps)
      frame-stream
      (qeval (first-conjunct exps)
             (qeval (rest-conjuncts exps) frame-stream))))
```

Which means:
- For every match from `query1`, run `query2`
- So if `query1` returns `n/k` frames, and for each we scan the database again → total cost is `n × n/k = n²/k` database scans

But what if we:
1. Run both queries **independently**
2. Then **merge compatible frames**

We’d only need to do:
- `n/k` scans for each query → total `2n/k`
- Then merge: up to `(n/k) × (n/k)` combinations

So total effort becomes:
- `2n/k + n²/k²` → which is better than `n²/k` for large `k`

---

## ✅ Strategy: Independent Evaluation + Frame Merging

Here’s how you'd implement this new `and`:

### Step 1: Evaluate Both Queries Separately

Evaluate `query1` and `query2` **on the same input stream**, producing two separate frame streams.

```scheme
(define (qeval-and-new exps frame-stream)
  (let ((q1 (first-conjunct exps))
        (q2 (second-conjunct exps)))
    (let ((stream1 (qeval q1 frame-stream))
          (stream2 (qeval q2 frame-stream)))
      (merge-frame-streams stream1 stream2))))
```

Now define `merge-frame-streams` to combine all possible pairs of frames where variable bindings are **consistent**.

---

## 🛠️ Step 2: Merge Two Frame Streams

Define a procedure that takes two frame streams and returns a stream of merged frames where variables agree.

This is similar to **join operations** in databases or **unification** in Prolog.

```scheme
(define (merge-frame-streams s1 s2)
  (stream-flatmap
   (lambda (frame1)
     (stream-filter-map
      (lambda (frame2)
        (let ((combined (merge-frames frame1 frame2)))
          (if combined
              (singleton-stream combined)
              the-empty-stream)))
     s2))
   s1))
```

Where:
- `merge-frames` attempts to merge two frames
- If they’re **inconsistent** (e.g., `?x = 3` in one, `?x = 5` in another), it fails
- Otherwise, returns a merged frame with all bindings

---

## 📌 Step 3: Frame Merging Logic

Implement `merge-frames` as follows:

```scheme
(define (merge-frames frame1 frame2)
  (define (merge-vars vars result)
    (if (null? vars)
        result
        (let ((var (caar vars))
             (val (cdar vars)))
          (let ((val2 (binding-in-frame var frame2)))
            (if (or (unbound? val2) (equal? val val2))
                (merge-vars (cdr vars) (extend-if-possible result var val))
                #f))))) ; conflict → no merge

  (define (extend-if-possible frame var val)
    (if (binding-in-frame var frame)
        (if (equal? val (binding-in-frame var frame))
            frame
            #f)
        (extend-frame frame var val)))

  (merge-vars (frame-bindings frame1) frame2))
```

This merges two frames:
- For each variable in `frame1`, check its value in `frame2`
- If consistent, keep it
- Else, discard the pair

This is **unification** — matching variables across frames.

## 🧪 Example Usage

Suppose your database has:

```scheme
(job (Ben Bitdiddle) (computer wizard))
(supervisor (Ben Bitdiddle) (Warbucks Oliver))
(job ?x (computer wizard))
```

Now try:

```scheme
(and (job ?x (computer wizard))
     (supervisor ?x ?y))
```

### With Original `and`:

- Run `job ?x (computer wizard)` → gets Ben
- Then run `supervisor ?x ?y` in that context → gets Warbucks

✅ Works fine, but not scalable

### With New `and`:

- Run both queries independently:
  - `job ?x (computer wizard)` → `[Ben]`
  - `supervisor ?x ?y` → `[Ben → Warbucks]`
- Then merge frames where `?x = Ben`
- Returns: `((?x Ben) (?y Warbucks))`

Same result, but more efficient on complex queries.

## 📊 Summary Table

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Goal | Optimize `and` to avoid repeated database scans |
| Current Behavior | Processes second query for each result of first |
| New Approach | Run both queries separately, then merge |
| Key Operation | Frame merging/unification |
| Performance Gain | From `O(n²/k)` to `O(n/k + n²/k²)` |
| Real-World Analogy | Like joining two tables instead of nested loops |

## 💡 Final Thought

This exercise shows how to apply **database optimization techniques** to logic-based systems.

By evaluating both sides of an `and` clause independently, and only merging compatible results:
- You reduce redundant database scanning
- Improve performance on complex queries
- Support **parallel evaluation** of clauses

It's a great example of how declarative systems can benefit from **query planning** and **optimization strategies** used in relational databases.

The key insight:
> ✅ **Unify frames** instead of re-running queries on each partial result

This mirrors real-world engines like Datalog, which use **join-based resolution** for efficiency.

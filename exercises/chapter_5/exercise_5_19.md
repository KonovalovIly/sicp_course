## üß† Understanding the Simulator Structure

The simulator uses an instruction list like:

```scheme
(controller
  (assign continue (label fact-done))
fact-loop
  (test (op =) (reg n) (const 1))
  (branch (label base-case))

  (save continue)
  (save n)
  (assign n (op -) (reg n) (const 1))
  (assign continue (label fact-loop))
  (goto (label fact-loop))

base-case
  (assign val (const 1))
  (goto (reg continue))
...)
```

Each instruction is executed one at a time via `(machine 'execute)`.

We‚Äôll extend it with:
- A way to **track current instruction**
- A way to **set breakpoints by label and offset**
- A mechanism to **pause execution**

---

## üîÅ Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### 1. **Track Current Instruction and Label Mapping**

During assembly, build a mapping from labels to their position in the instruction list.

Example:

```scheme
(label-map machine) ‚Üí '((fact-loop . 0) (base-case . 3) (fact-done . 6))
```

This lets us find where `fact-loop` occurs in the instruction stream.

Then we can define:

```scheme
(define (find-instruction machine label offset)
  (let* ((map (machine 'get-label-map))
         (pos (assoc label map)))
    (+ (cdr pos) offset)))
```

So if `fact-loop` is at position 0, then `offset 4` would be instruction at index 4.

---

### 2. **Add Breakpoint Support to Machine Model**

We‚Äôll store a list of breakpoints as `(label offset)` pairs.

Add methods to manage them:

```scheme
(machine 'add-breakpoint label offset)
(machine 'remove-breakpoint label offset)
(machine 'clear-breakpoints)
```

Internally, the machine keeps a list of breakpoints: `'((fact-loop . 4) (base-case . 0))`, etc.

---

### 3. **Modify Execution Loop to Check for Breakpoints**

Inside the inner loop of `execute`, before running each instruction:

```scheme
(define (execute machine)
  (let loop ((inst-index 0))
    (if (>= inst-index (length (machine 'get-instructions)))
        'done
        (let ((current-inst (list-ref (machine 'get-instructions) inst-index)))
      ;; Check if this is a breakpoint
      (if (member (cons (machine 'get-current-label) inst-index) (machine 'get-breakpoints))
          (begin
            (display "Breakpoint hit at ")
            (display (machine 'get-current-label))
            (display ", offset ")
            (display (- inst-index label-pos))
            (newline)
            (machine 'wait-for-command)))

      ;; Execute instruction
      (execute-inst (machine 'get-instruction inst-index))
      (loop (+ inst-index 1))))))
```

Where:
- `get-current-label` returns the label preceding the current instruction
- `wait-for-command` pauses and allows user input

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Part 1: Define `set-breakpoint`

```scheme
(define (set-breakpoint machine label offset)
  (let* ((label-map (machine 'get-label-map))
         (pos (assoc label label-map)))
    (if pos
        (let ((target (+ (cdr pos) offset)))
          (machine 'add-breakpoint target)))))
```

This finds the instruction number that corresponds to `label + offset`.

---

## üìå Part 2: Define `proceed-machine`

```scheme
(define (proceed-machine machine)
  (machine 'resume-execution))
```

Where `resume-execution` runs the machine until next breakpoint.

Inside the machine:

```scheme
(set! (machine 'resume-execution)
     (lambda ()
       (start-execution-from (machine 'get-current-pc))))
```

And you track PC (program counter) in the machine:

```scheme
(set-register-contents! machine 'pc 0)
```

---

## üéØ Part 3: Canceling Breakpoints

```scheme
(define (cancel-breakpoint machine label offset)
  (let* ((label-map (machine 'get-label-map))
         (pos (assoc label label-map)))
    (if pos
        (let ((target (+ (cdr pos) offset)))
          (machine 'remove-breakpoint target)))))

(define (cancel-all-breakpoints machine)
  (machine 'clear-breakpoints))
```

This removes either a single breakpoint or all of them.

---

## üß™ Example Usage

Suppose you have a factorial machine with controller:

```scheme
(controller
  start
  (assign continue (label fact-done))
fact-loop
  (test (op =) (reg n) (const 1))
  (branch (label base-case))

  (save continue)
  (save n)
  (assign n (op -) (reg n) (const 1))
  (assign continue (label fact-loop))
  (goto (label fact-loop))

base-case
  (assign val (const 1))
  (goto (reg continue))

fact-done)
```

Set a breakpoint just before the assignment to `continue` after `base-case`:

```scheme
(set-breakpoint fact-machine 'base-case 1)
```

When the machine reaches that instruction, it will pause and let you inspect registers.

## üí° Final Thought

This exercise shows how to add **interactive debugging support** to a low-level simulator.

By combining:
- Label tracking
- Instruction counting
- Pause/resume logic

You get a full **debugging interface**, similar to what you‚Äôd expect in real-world debuggers.

It also builds on previous exercises:
- Exercise 5.15 ‚Äî instruction counting
- Exercise 5.17 ‚Äî label tracing
- Exercise 5.18 ‚Äî register tracing

Together, these tools give deep insight into machine behavior.

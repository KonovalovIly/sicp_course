## üß† Understanding the Memory Model

In *SICP* Section 5.3, memory is represented as a vector with two parts per cell:
- `car` part
- `cdr` part

Each cons cell takes **two memory locations**, and the `free` pointer advances after each allocation.

We‚Äôll assume that:
- The memory is an array of cells: `p0`, `p1`, `p2`, ...
- Each cell has two fields: `[car, cdr]`
- `free` starts at `p1` (as given)

We‚Äôll simulate memory allocation for the expressions:

```scheme
(define x (cons 1 2))
(define y (list x x))
```

## üîÅ Step-by-Step Allocation

### Step 1: Evaluate `(define x (cons 1 2))`

A `cons` allocates two memory cells:

| Pointer | car | cdr |
|---------|-----|-----|
| p1      | 1   | p2  |
| p2      | 2   | '() |

Then:
- `free` moves to `p3`
- `x = p1`

So memory looks like this:

```
Memory Vector:
p0: [ , ]    ; unused
p1: [1, p2]
p2: [2, '()]
p3: [ , ]    ; next available
```

‚úÖ So far:
- `x ‚Üí p1`
- `free ‚Üí p3`

---

### Step 2: Evaluate `(define y (list x x))`

This creates a list containing two elements: both pointing to `x`.

A `list` of two elements uses **two cons cells**.

Allocate first cons cell:

| Pointer | car | cdr |
|--------|-----|-----|
| p3     | p1  | p4  |

Second cons cell:

| Pointer | car | cdr |
|--------|-----|-----|
| p4     | p1  | '() |

Now:
- `free` moves to `p6`
- `y = p3`

Final memory layout:

```
Memory Vector:
p0: [ , ]
p1: [1, p2]   ; x
p2: [2, '()]
p3: [p1, p4]  ; y
p4: [p1, '()]
p5: [ , ]     ; free
```

## üì¶ Box-and-Pointer Representation

Here's a textual **box-and-pointer diagram** for the result:

```
x ‚Üí [1 | p2]
        ‚Üì
        [2 | '()]

y ‚Üí [p1 | p4]
         ‚Üì      ‚Üò
       [p1 | '()]
         ‚Üì
       [1 | p2]
           ‚Üì
         [2 | '()]
```

Note:
- Both elements of `y` point to `x`
- So both point to `p1` (start of `x`'s pair)
- This results in a shared structure ‚Äî both elements of `y` refer to the same cons cell

---

## üéØ Final Results

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Final value of `free` | `p6` |
| Value of `x` | `p1` |
| Value of `y` | `p3` |
| Are both elements of `y` the same? | ‚úÖ Yes ‚Äì they both point to `x` |

## üìä Summary Table

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Goal | Understand memory allocation of list structures |
| Strategy | Use box-and-pointer diagrams and memory vectors |
| Cons Cell Size | Two memory units |
| Initial `free` | p1 |
| After allocations | `free = p6` |
| x points to | p1 |
| y points to | p3 |
| Shared Structure | Yes ‚Äì both elements of `y` point to `x` |
| Real-World Analogy | Like heap management in Lisp or Scheme interpreters |

## üí° Final Thought

This exercise shows how **heap memory is managed** in a register machine or interpreter.

By tracing how cons cells are allocated and linked:
- You gain insight into how lists are stored
- You see how shared structure works in memory
- And you understand how garbage collection and pointer management work

It builds on earlier ideas from Chapter 5 about:
- How registers hold pointers
- How cons cells use memory
- How `free` pointer advances

This kind of low-level understanding is essential when building:
- Interpreters
- Compilers
- Garbage collectors
- Or optimizing data structures

## 🧠 Understanding the Problem

Newton's method for square root works by:
- Starting with an initial guess
- Repeatedly improving it until it is "good enough"

In register-machine terms:
- We need registers: `x`, `guess`, `temp`, `tolerance`
- We need basic ops: `abs`, `square`, `/`, `+`, `<`, etc.
- The loop continues until the guess is good enough

## 🔢 Step-by-Step Register Machine Design

### Registers

| Register | Purpose |
|---------|----------|
| `x` | Input value — find √x |
| `guess` | Current estimate of √x |
| `temp` | Temporary storage during calculations |
| `tolerance` | Threshold for convergence (e.g., 0.001) |
| `one` | Constant 1.0 |
| `two` | Used in average function |

### Primitive Version (with `good-enough?` and `improve` as black boxes)

Let’s define a simplified version first.

#### Controller Instructions

```scheme
sqrt
  (assign guess (const 1.0)) ; Initial guess

loop
  (perform (op good-enough?) (reg guess)) ; Test if guess is close enough
  (test (op good-enough?) (reg guess))
  (branch (label done))

  (assign temp (op improve) (reg guess)) ; Improve guess
  (assign guess (reg temp))
  (goto (label loop))

done
  (perform (op print) (reg guess))
```

This assumes `good-enough?` and `improve` are **primitive operations**.

Now let’s implement them using only basic arithmetic.

## 📐 Expand `good-enough?` and `improve` Using Arithmetic

### `good-enough?` → Check Convergence

Goal: `(abs (- (square guess) x)) < tolerance`

Steps:
1. Compute `guess²`
2. Subtract `x`
3. Take absolute value
4. Compare to `tolerance`

#### Implementation

```scheme
(assign temp (op *) (reg guess) (reg guess)) ; guess²
(assign temp (op -) (reg temp) (reg x))       ; guess² - x
(assign temp (op abs) (reg temp))             ; abs(guess² - x)
(test (op <) (reg temp) (reg tolerance))
(branch (label done))
```

---

### `improve guess` → Average(guess, x/guess)

Goal: `average guess (x / guess)`
Which is: `(guess + x/guess) / 2`

#### Implementation

```scheme
(assign temp (op /) (reg x) (reg guess)) ; x / guess
(assign temp (op +) (reg guess) (reg temp)) ; guess + x/guess
(assign temp (op /) (reg temp) (reg two)) ; divide by 2
(assign guess (reg temp))
```

Where:
- `two` is a constant register set to `2.0`
- `temp` holds intermediate values

## 🛠️ Final Register Machine Definition

Here’s how you'd write the full machine in the register-machine language:

```scheme
(define sqrt-machine
  (make-machine
   '(x guess temp one two tolerance) ; Registers
   (list (list '< <)
         (list '> >)
         (list '+ +)
         (list '- -)
         (list '* *)
         (list '/ /)
         (list 'abs abs))
   '(
     (assign one (const 1.0))
     (assign two (const 2.0))
     (assign tolerance (const 0.001))

     (assign guess (reg one)) ; Initialize guess = 1.0

     sqrt-loop
     ;; Check if guess is good enough
     (assign temp (op *) (reg guess) (reg guess)) ; guess²
     (assign temp (op -) (reg temp) (reg x))       ; guess² - x
     (assign temp (op abs) (reg temp))             ; abs(guess² - x)
     (test (op <) (reg temp) (reg tolerance))
     (branch (label sqrt-done))

     ;; Improve guess
     (assign temp (op /) (reg x) (reg guess)) ; x/guess
     (assign temp (op +) (reg guess) (reg temp)) ; guess + x/guess
     (assign temp (op /) (reg temp) (reg two)) ; divide by 2
     (assign guess (reg temp))
     (goto (label sqrt-loop))

     sqrt-done
     (perform (op print) (reg guess))
     )))
```

## 📋 How to Run It

To simulate computing `√2`:

```scheme
(set-register-contents! sqrt-machine 'x 2.0)
(start sqrt-machine)
→ Eventually prints ≈ 1.414
```

This machine will keep iterating until the guess converges within the tolerance.

Set:

```scheme
(set-register-contents! sqrt-machine 'x 2.0)

Run:

```scheme

           [start = 1.0]     [operations]
                               ▼
                             (op *) → guess²
                             (op -) → guess² - x
                             (op abs) → error
                             (op <) → compare with tolerance
                             (op /) → x/guess
                             (op +) → guess + x/guess
                             (op /) → divide by 2
```

The controller directs which operation to perform next based on test results.

## 💡 Final Thought

This exercise shows how to translate a recursive functional algorithm into **low-level control logic** using registers and primitive operations.

By implementing:
- Iterative improvement
- Conditional branching
- Basic arithmetic

You get a feel for how complex algorithms run on simple machines.

It also sets the stage for more advanced interpreters and compilers that simulate higher-level languages.

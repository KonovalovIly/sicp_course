## 🧠 Understanding the Code

From the instruction sequence, we can infer:
- It's a compiled procedure with one local variable `x`
- The procedure tests whether `x` is equal to `2`
  - If yes → returns `3`
  - If no → returns `x - 1`

So the structure must be:

```scheme
(lambda (x)
  (if (= x 2)
      3
      (- x 1)))
```

This function takes one argument `x`, and returns:
- `3` if `x == 2`
- `x - 1` otherwise

## 📌 Reconstructing the Original Expression

Since the lambda is defined and then jumped to via `(goto (label after-lambda))`, it must have been assigned to some name.

So likely, the original expression was:

```scheme
(define (f x)
  (if (= x 2)
      3
      (- x 1)))
```

Or simply:

```scheme
(lambda (x)
  (if (= x 2)
      3
      (- x 1)))
```

Which would compile into a procedure as shown in Figure 5.18.

## 🔍 Why This Matches

Let’s walk through the code step-by-step:

| Instruction | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `(assign val (op make-compiled-procedure) label entry)` | Create closure for lambda at `entry` |
| `(goto (label after-lambda))` | Skip over procedure body until called |
| `entry` | Start of lambda body |
| `(assign env ...)` | Set up environment |
| `(save continue)` | Save return point |
| `(assign exp (op lookup x))` | Get value of `x` |
| `(test (= x 2))` | Compare to constant |
| Branch to `true-branch` or `false-branch` | Based on test result |
| `true-branch` | Return `3` |
| `false-branch` | Return `x - 1` |

This matches exactly what the lambda does.

## 🎯 Final Answer

The expression compiled into the machine instructions in **Figure 5.18** is:

```scheme
(lambda (x)
  (if (= x 2)
      3
      (- x 1)))
```

Or equivalently:

```scheme
(define (f x)
  (if (= x 2)
      3
      (- x 1)))
```

✅ Both would generate similar code when compiled.

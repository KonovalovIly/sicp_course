## 🧠 Understanding Open Coding

Right now, when you write:

```scheme
(+ a 1)
```

The compiler generates something like:

```scheme
(assign proc (op lookup-variable-value) (const +) (reg env))
(save continue)
(assign continue (label after-call))
(save env)
(assign val (op lookup-variable-value) (const a) (reg env))
(assign argl (op list) (reg val))
(assign val (const 1))
(assign argl (op cons) (reg val) (reg argl))
(restore env)
(goto (label primitive-apply))
```

But all we really need is:

```scheme
(assign val (op lookup-variable-value) (const a) (reg env))
(assign val (op +) (reg val) (const 1))
```

✅ This avoids:
- Building `argl`
- Testing `proc` type
- Dispatching to apply logic

We call this **open coding** — generating direct machine instructions instead of general-purpose application code.

---

# ✅ Part (a): Write `spread-arguments` Helper

We want a helper that compiles operands and assigns them to registers like `arg1`, `arg2`, etc.

### Goal

Given `(= x y)`, compile each operand into a register:

```scheme
(assign arg1 (reg val)) ; x
(assign arg2 (reg val)) ; y
```

### Implementation

```scheme
(define (spread-arguments operands target-env)
  (define (loop ops n)
    (if (null? ops)
        (make-instruction-sequence '() '() '()) ; no more operands
        (let ((code (compile (car ops) 'val 'next-arg)))
          (preserving '(env continue)
                      code
                      (append-instruction-sequences
                       code
                       (tack-on-instruction-sequence
                        (make-instruction-sequence '() (list (string->symbol (string-append "arg" (number->string n)))
                          `((assign ,(string->symbol (string-append "arg" (number->string n))) (reg val)))
                        (loop (cdr ops) (+ n 1)))))))
  (loop operands 1))
```

This:
- Compiles each operand to `val`
- Saves it to `arg1`, `arg2`, etc.
- Preserves environment and continuation
- Handles nested expressions like `(+ (* x y) z)`

# ✅ Part (b): Code Generators for Primitive Operations

Now implement code generators for `=`, `+`, `-`, and `*`.

Each generator will:
- Use `spread-arguments` to get operands into `arg1`, `arg2`
- Then perform the operation directly using machine primitives

---

## 🛠️ Example: Generator for `+`

```scheme
(define (compile-open-coded-+ exp target linkage)
  (let ((then-linkage (if (eq? linkage 'next)
                         'next
                         (make-label 'add-done))))
    (let ((code (spread-arguments (cdr exp) '())))
      (end-with-linkage
       linkage
       (preserving '(continue)
                   code
                   (append-instruction-sequences
                    code
                    (make-instruction-sequence
                     '(arg1 arg2) (list target)
                     `((assign ,target (op +) (reg arg1) (reg arg2)
                        ,@(if (eq? linkage 'next)
                              '()
                              `((goto (label ,then-linkage)))))))))))
```

Similarly for `*`, `-`, and `=`

---

## 📌 Sample Generated Code for `(* x y)`

With open coding:

```scheme
(assign val (op lookup-variable-value) (const x) (reg env))
(assign arg1 (reg val))
(assign val (op lookup-variable-value) (const y) (reg env))
(assign arg2 (reg val))
(assign val (op *) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))
```

Without open coding:

Much longer — includes:
- Saving/restoring `env`, `continue`
- Building `argl`
- Looking up `*` in environment
- Branching based on procedure type

Open coding avoids all that.

# ✅ Part (c): Compare Factorial with/without Open Coding

Compile both versions of factorial:

### Recursive Version:

```scheme
(define (factorial-alt n)
  (if (= n 1)
      1
      (* n (factorial-alt (- n 1))))
```

### Iterative Version:

```scheme
(define (factorial n)
  (define (iter product counter)
    (if (> counter n)
        product
        (iter (* counter product) (+ counter 1))))
  (iter 1 1))
```

## 📊 Compiled Code Comparison

| Feature | Without Open Coding | With Open Coding |
|--------|----------------------|------------------|
| Stack Usage | High – many saves/restores |
| Speed | Slower – dispatch overhead |
| Instruction Count | More due to apply logic |
| Register Usage | Many intermediate steps |
| Arithmetic Instructions | Direct use of `+`, `*`, `=` |
| Code Size | Larger |
| Performance | Better |

Example difference:

Without open coding:

```scheme
; lots of setup and apply logic
(goto (label primitive-apply))
```

With open coding:

```scheme
(assign arg1 (op lookup-variable-value) (const x) ...)
(assign arg2 (const 1))
(assign val (op +) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))
```

---

# ✅ Part (d): Handle Arbitrary Number of Operands

We can extend `+` and `*` to handle multiple arguments by compiling:

```scheme
(+ a b c d)
→ (op +) → add `a + b`, then `+ c`, then `+ d`

Same for `*`: multiply one at a time

---

## 🛠️ Modify Code Generator for `+`

```scheme
(define (compile-open-coded-+ exp target linkage)
  (let ((then-linkage (if (eq? linkage 'next)
                         'next
                         (make-label 'add-done)))
        (args (cdr exp)))
    (let ((code (spread-arguments args '())))
      (let ((first-code (car code))
            (rest-ops (cdr code)))
        (end-with-linkage
         linkage
         (append-instruction-sequences
          first-code
          (fold-left
           (lambda (seq op-code)
             (preserving '(continue)
                         seq
                         (append-instruction-sequences
                          op-code
                          (make-instruction-sequence
                           '(arg1 arg2) '(arg1)
                           `((assign arg1 (op +) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))))))
           (make-instruction-sequence '() '(arg1) '((assign arg1 (reg val)))
           rest-ops)))))))
```

This way:
- First operand goes into `arg1`
- Each additional operand is added to `arg2`, then result stored back in `arg1`
- Final result ends up in `arg1`, which is assigned to `val` or another target

So:

```scheme
(+ 1 2 3 4)
→ (assign arg1 1)
→ (assign arg2 2) → (assign arg1 (op +) arg1 arg2)
→ (assign arg2 3) → repeat
→ (assign arg2 4) → repeat
→ (assign val (reg arg1))
```

## 💡 Final Thought

This exercise shows how **compilers optimize common operations** to avoid runtime overhead.

By implementing open coding:
- You reduce unnecessary procedure calls
- You eliminate environment lookups and apply logic
- And improve performance significantly

It mirrors real-world compilers:
- That inline small functions
- Or use special registers for fast operations

And gives deep insight into how **low-level optimizations** translate to high-level performance gains.

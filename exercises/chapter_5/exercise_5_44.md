## üß† Understanding the Problem

In Exercise 5.38, you implemented **open coding** for operators like `+`, `*`, `-`, and `=`, by recognizing their names and compiling them into direct machine instructions.

But this approach assumes that:
- The name `+` always refers to the **primitive addition**
- Not considering variable rebinding via lambdas or `set!`

This leads to **incorrect behavior** when names are rebound.

Example:

```scheme
(define +matrix ...) ; some custom matrix addition
((lambda (+ * a b x y)
   (+ (* a x) (* b y)))
 #matrix-add #matrix-mul ...)
```

Should call the passed-in `+` and `*`, not the built-in ones.

But current compiler will still generate:

```scheme
(assign val (op +) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))
```

Even though `+` is now a **lambda argument**

So:
> ‚ùó We must check the **compile-time environment** before deciding to open-code an operator

---

## üîÅ Step-by-Step Fix

We'll modify the code generator for expressions like:

```scheme
(+ ‚ü®a‚ü© ‚ü®b‚ü©)
```

To first check whether `+` is **bound to the actual primitive**, or has been **replaced** by a lambda argument or local definition.

This requires integrating the **compile-time environment** into the decision logic of the open-coding mechanism.

## üõ†Ô∏è Part 1: Update Open-Coding Logic

Modify the `compile-open-coded-primitive` function to use `find-variable` from Exercise 5.41.

Here's the original idea behind open coding:

```scheme
(compile '(+ a 1) ...) ‚Üí emits direct arithmetic instructions
```

Now we change it to:

```scheme
(if (variable-in-scope? '+ compile-time-env)
    (compile-application 'primed version)
    (compile-direct '+' usage)
```

Implementing this:

```scheme
(define (compile-open-coded-+ exp target linkage compile-time-env)
  (let ((operator '+)
        (operands (cdr exp)))
    (if (find-variable '+ compile-time-env)
        ;; Variable is rebound ‚Üí compile as normal application
        (compile-application exp target linkage compile-time-env)
        ;; Else ‚Üí proceed with open coding
        (compile-lexical-+ operands target linkage compile-time-env))))
```

Where:
- `find-variable` is from Exercise 5.41
- If `+` appears in the compile-time environment, it means the symbol has been **rebound**
- So we fall back to general application logic

---

## üìå Part 2: Example ‚Äì Rebinding `+` and `*`

Given:

```scheme
(lambda (+ * a b x y)
  (+ (* a x) (* b y)))
```

Compile-time environment during body compilation:

```scheme
'((+ * a b x y) ())
```

So:
- `find-variable '+ '((+ * a b x y))` ‚Üí returns `(0 . 0)`
- `find-variable '* '((+ * a b x y))` ‚Üí returns `(0 . 1)`

Thus, `+` and `*` are **not global primitives** here ‚Üí should be compiled as **regular procedure calls**

‚úÖ This prevents incorrect open-coding

---

## üéØ Part 3: Code Generator for Open-Coded Primitives

Update all open-coded generators (`compile-open-coded-+`, etc.) to do this:

```scheme
(define (compile-open-coded-+ exp target linkage compile-time-env)
  (let ((var-info (find-variable '+ compile-time-env)))
    (if (eq? var-info 'not-found)
        ;; Safe to open-code
        (compile-lexical-+ ...)
        ;; Else, treat as regular application
        (compile-application ...))))
```

Similarly for `*`, `-`, and `=`

This ensures:
- You only open-code `+` when it's **not redefined**
- Otherwise, you treat it like any other procedure

---

## üìä Summary Table

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Goal | Prevent open-coding of redefined primitives |
| Strategy | Use `find-variable` to detect rebinding |
| Key Change | Add compile-time lookup before open-coding |
| Real-World Analogy | Like checking shadowed variables in nested scopes |
| Compile-Time Env Usage | Tracks where symbols are defined |
| Benefit | Correctly handles lambda arguments named after primitives |

## üí° Final Thought

This exercise shows how important **compile-time environments** are for generating correct code.

By checking lexical scope before applying optimizations:
- You ensure that high-level language features like **shadowing** work correctly
- And prevent performance hacks from breaking semantics

It mirrors real-world compilers:
- That track variable bindings to avoid misoptimization
- Especially when variables share names with built-ins

With this fix:
- Your compiler respects **lexical scope**
- It avoids incorrectly optimizing user-defined functions
- And generates correct code for all cases

This completes the picture of how to build a robust, efficient Scheme-to-machine-code compiler.

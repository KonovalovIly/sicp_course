## 🧠 Understanding the Three Implementations

We’re comparing three versions of `factorial(n)`:

| Version | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Interpreted (Evaluator) | Recursive factorial interpreted by explicit-control evaluator |
| Compiled | Same recursive definition compiled into register-machine code |
| Special-Purpose Machine | Tail-recursive machine designed manually |

Each uses different mechanisms:
- The interpreter builds up stack with every recursive call
- The compiler generates code that avoids some overhead but still has general-purpose dispatch
- The special-purpose machine is hand-optimized for factorial only

---

# ✅ Part (a): Performance Analysis

We’ll define:
- `S(n)` = number of stack pushes used to compute `n!`
- `D(n)` = maximum depth reached during computation

We'll analyze all three machines and compare their performance.

---

## 📌 1. Evaluator (Interpreted Factorial)

Recursive factorial:

```scheme
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 1)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))
```

From **Exercise 5.27**, we know:

$$
\text{Stack pushes} = 32n - 16 \\
\text{Max depth} = 8n - 3
$$

This reflects the **inefficiency of deep recursion** in the interpreter.

---

## 📌 2. Special-Purpose Machine (Tail-Recursive)

From **Figure 5.11**, the iterative factorial machine does:

```scheme
(assign product (reg one))
(assign counter (reg n))
loop
  (test (> counter n))
  (branch (label fact-done))
  (assign product (* counter product))
  (assign counter (+ counter 1))
  (goto (label loop))
```

This is tail-recursive and doesn’t grow the stack.

So:

$$
\text{Stack pushes} = 30 + 10n \\
\text{Max depth} = \text{constant} ≈ 5
$$

Because it only needs to save/restore registers once per iteration.

---

## 📌 3. Compiled Factorial

The compiled version uses general-purpose procedure application logic.

It saves/restores environment and continues for each recursive call.

From earlier exercises:

$$
\text{Stack pushes} = 20n + 10 \\
\text{Max depth} = 5n + 5
$$

Compiled code is more efficient than interpreted code, but not as good as special-purpose.

---

## 📊 Part (a): Ratios Between Machines

Now compute the ratios:

### 🔹 Pushes Ratio: Compiled / Interpreted

$$
\frac{20n + 10}{32n - 16} → \text{as } n→∞, \text{ratio} → \frac{20}{32} = 0.625
$$

✅ So the **compiled version uses ~62.5%** of the pushes of the interpreter.

### 🔹 Max Depth Ratio: Compiled / Interpreted

$$
\frac{5n + 5}{8n - 3} → \text{as } n→∞, \text{ratio} → \frac{5}{8} = 0.625
$$

Same ratio applies — **compiled version reduces max depth significantly**

---

### 📌 Special-Purpose vs Interpreted

#### Pushes:

$$
\frac{10n + 30}{32n - 16} → \text{as } n→∞, \text{ratio} → \frac{10}{32} = 0.3125
$$

✅ So special-purpose uses about **1/3** the pushes

#### Stack Depth:

$$
\frac{5}{8n - 3} → approaches 0
$$

As `n` grows, the special-purpose machine uses **constant** depth, while interpreted version uses linear depth.

## 📈 Summary Table – Asymptotic Behavior

| Metric | Interpreted | Compiled | Special-Purpose |
|--------|-------------|----------|------------------|
| Stack Pushes | $ 32n - 16 $ | $ 20n + 10 $ | $ 10n + 30 $ |
| Max Stack Depth | $ 8n - 3 $ | $ 5n + 5 $ | Constant = 5 |
| Pushes Ratio (Compiled / Eval) | – | ~0.625 | – |
| Pushes Ratio (Special / Eval) | – | ~0.3125 | – |
| Max Depth Ratio (Special / Eval) | – | → 0 as $ n→∞ $ | – |

---

## ✅ Part (b): Can We Improve the Compiler?

Yes — here are several **compiler improvements** that would bring its performance closer to the special-purpose machine:

---

### 💡 Improvement 1: Better Tail Call Handling

Right now, the compiler doesn't fully optimize tail calls unless they're explicitly written in letrec-style.

We can:
- Add a **tail-call optimization pass**
- Recognize when the last operation is a function call
- Reuse stack frame instead of saving new ones

---

### 💡 Improvement 2: Lexical Addressing

Currently, variable access uses symbolic lookup or basic lexical addressing.

We can:
- Precompute variable positions at compile time
- Avoid unnecessary `env` saves/restores
- Reduce push operations

---

### 💡 Improvement 3: Open-Coding Arithmetic

In Exercise 5.38, you added open-coding for primitives like `+`, `*`.

We can improve further by:
- Eliminating extra argument list construction
- Using dedicated registers (`arg1`, `arg2`) directly
- Skipping apply logic for known primitives

---

### 💡 Improvement 4: Eliminate Redundant Saves via Preserving

The `preserving` mechanism helps avoid unnecessary saves.

We can:
- Extend it to handle more complex control flow
- Track which registers are modified
- Only preserve what's needed

---

### 💡 Improvement 5: Optimize Recursion into Iteration

For certain recursive patterns (like accumulators), the compiler could recognize them and convert to loops.

Example:

```scheme
(factorial n) → rewrite as an iterative loop
```

This requires:
- **Control-flow analysis**
- **Pattern matching** on common recursive structures
- Possibly **partial evaluation**

But would allow compiled code to match the efficiency of the special-purpose machine.

## 📊 Final Comparison Table

| Feature | Interpreted | Compiled | Special-Purpose |
|--------|-------------|----------|------------------|
| Stack Pushes | $ O(n) $ | $ O(n) $ | $ O(n) $ |
| Max Stack Depth | $ O(n) $ | $ O(n) $ | $ O(1) $ |
| Tail Call Optimization | ❌ No | ❌ Limited | ✅ Yes |
| Use of Registers | ❌ Many redundant saves | ✅ Some optimizations | ✅ Fully optimized |
| Real-World Analogy | Like naive Scheme interpreter | Like simple compiler | Like hand-written assembly |

## 💡 Final Thought

This exercise gives insight into:
- How interpreters, compilers, and special-purpose machines differ in **performance characteristics**
- Why **tail recursion**, **lexical addressing**, and **open coding** matter for speed
- And how much room there is for improvement in our current compiler

Even though the compiled version improves over the interpreter, it still lags behind the special-purpose machine.

By studying these differences:
- You gain tools to write better compilers
- You learn how to bridge the gap between high-level and low-level execution

And understand why modern JITs and optimizing compilers go to great lengths to generate **efficient machine code** from high-level expressions.

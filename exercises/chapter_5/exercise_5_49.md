## üß† Understanding the Goal

We want to build a register machine that acts like a **REPL loop**, but instead of interpreting, it:
1. **Reads** Scheme-like expressions
2. **Compiles** them into register-machine instructions
3. **Assembles** and runs them in the simulator
4. **Prints** the result

This requires integrating:
- The **compiler**
- The **assembler**
- A way to **capture user input**
- And a mechanism to **install compiled procedures** in the environment

It‚Äôs a simplified version of what modern systems like:
- JavaScript engines (V8, SpiderMonkey)
- Python interpreters with JIT
- Racket or Chez Scheme hybrids

## üîÅ Step-by-Step Machine Design

### Registers

| Register | Purpose |
|---------|----------|
| `input` | Holds the expression entered by the user |
| `code` | Compiled instruction sequence |
| `env` | Global environment |
| `val` | Result of execution |
| `continue` | Return point after compilation/execution |
| `print-result` | Label for printing logic |

---

### Key Operations

You‚Äôll need these as primitive operations:

```scheme
(list 'read read) ; Read expression from input
(list 'compile compile) ; Your Scheme-to-machine-code compiler
(list 'assemble assemble) ; Convert symbolic instructions to machine code
(list 'execute execute) ; Run assembled code
(list 'display display-result) ; Print value
```

These are all defined in your Scheme system and used in the controller.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Controller Logic ‚Äì Full Loop

Here is the **controller instruction sequence** for the new machine:

```scheme
(controller
  (assign continue (label print-result))
  (assign env (op get-global-environment))

loop
  (perform (op prompt-for-input) (const "EC-Eval input:"))
  (assign input (op read))

  ;; Compile the expression
  (assign code (op compile) (reg input) (const val) (const next)) ; compile to return result in val

  ;; Assemble the compiled code
  (assign code (op assemble) (reg code) (reg machine))

  ;; Execute the assembled code
  (assign val (op execute) (reg code) (reg env))

  ;; Print result
  (goto (label print-result))

print-result
  (perform (op display) (reg val))
  (goto (label loop)))
```

---

## üìå Part 1: Reading and Compiling Expressions

The machine first prompts for input and reads an expression.

Then compiles it using the compiler from *Section 5.5*:
- Output target: `'val`
- Linkage: `'next` ‚Üí continue immediately

So the compiler returns a procedure that puts its result in `val` and continues execution.

---

## üéØ Part 2: Assembling and Executing

Once compiled, the machine uses `assemble` to convert symbolic instructions into executable code.

Then it calls `execute`, passing the current environment.

After execution completes:
- The result is in `val`
- It prints and loops back to `read`

This mimics a real **dynamic language interpreter with JIT compilation**

## üßÆ Example Usage

Define this factorial function inside the loop:

```scheme
(compile-and-run '(define (factorial n)
                   (if (= n 1)
                       1
                       (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
```

Then run:

```scheme
(factorial 5)
‚Üí 120
```

Or define a lambda directly:

```scheme
((lambda (x) (+ x x)) 10)
‚Üí 20
```

All of this should work without calling the explicit-control evaluator.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Optional: Support Definitions Dynamically

To make `define` work within the loop:
- Modify the compiler to install definitions in the global environment
- Or return a closure that can be assigned via `(set! ‚ü®name‚ü© ‚ü®compiled-proc‚ü©)` logic

This mirrors how real systems manage top-level bindings.

## üìä Summary Table

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Goal | Build a REPL that compiles and executes on the fly |
| Strategy | Use compiler + assembler as primitives |
| Registers Needed | `input`, `code`, `val`, `env`, `continue` |
| Core Loop | Read ‚Üí Compile ‚Üí Assemble ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Print |
| Real-World Use | Like JIT compilers or dynamic languages |
| Performance | Faster than interpreter, slower than pre-compiled |
| Integration Point | Compiler and evaluator must share environment |

## üí° Final Thought

This exercise shows how to build a **self-contained execution model** that supports:
- Dynamic reading of Scheme expressions
- Compilation into register-machine code
- Execution of that code
- Printing results

By designing a custom controller that integrates the compiler and assembler as primitive operations:
- You gain insight into how **JIT compilers** work
- You understand how **interpreted and compiled code can coexist**
- And you see how **environments and closures** are managed during runtime

This kind of system forms the core of many modern language implementations.

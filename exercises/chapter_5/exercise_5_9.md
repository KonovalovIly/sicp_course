## üß† Understanding the Simulator‚Äôs Current Behavior

In *SICP* Section 5.2, operations like `+`, `-`, `=`, etc., are defined in a list passed to `make-machine`.

The controller instructions are parsed by procedures like `make-operation-exp`, which extract operands from expressions like:

```scheme
(op +) (reg x) (const 3)
```

But currently, nothing prevents you from writing:

```scheme
(assign a (op +) (reg x) (label some-label))
```

Which will pass `some-label` to `+` ‚Üí likely causing an error or incorrect behavior.

So we need to **detect this during parsing**, not at runtime.

---

## üîß Step-by-Step Fix

We'll modify the expression parser to check that all operands to operations are either:
- `(reg ‚ü®name‚ü©)` ‚Üí register
- `(const ‚ü®value‚ü©)` ‚Üí constant
- Or just a bare number (if supported)

Not `(label ...)`

Let‚Äôs walk through how to do this.

---

### 1. **Locate the Expression Processing Code**

In the simulator, look for functions like:

```scheme
(define (make-operation-exp op exp machine labels operations)
  (let ((op-proc (find-operation op operations))
        (input-exps (operation-arg-exps exp)))
    (lambda ()
      (apply op-proc (map (lambda (exp) (get-value exp machine labels)) input-exps))))
```

Where:
- `exp` is something like: `(op +) (reg x) (label some-label)`
- It extracts the arguments via `operation-arg-exps`
- Then applies them with `get-value`

---

### 2. **Define `get-value` Safely**

Modify `get-value` to ensure it only accepts valid types.

Original version:

```scheme
(define (get-value exp machine labels)
  (cond ((constant-exp? exp)
         (constant-value exp))
        ((label-exp? exp)
         (lookup-label labels (label-exp->label-name exp)))
        ((register-exp? exp)
         (get-register-contents machine (register-exp->reg-name exp)))))
```

This lets labels be used as values ‚Äî but they‚Äôre **not numeric**.

So change it to:

```scheme
(define (get-value exp machine labels)
  (cond ((constant-exp? exp)
         (constant-value exp))
        ((register-exp? exp)
         (get-register-contents machine (register-exp->reg-name exp)))
        ((label-exp? exp)
         (error "Operation cannot take a label as operand" (label-exp->label-name exp)))
        (else
         (error "Unknown expression type -- GET-VALUE" exp))))
```

Now, any attempt to use a label as an operand raises an error during assembly.

---

## üìå Example That Fails After Change

Before:

```scheme
(assign a (op +) (reg b) (label loop))
‚Üí Tries to compute reg-b + address-of-loop
‚Üí Not meaningful!
```

After the fix:
```scheme
Error: Operation cannot take a label as operand: loop
```

‚úÖ Correctly blocks misuse of labels in arithmetic

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Optional: Restricting Allowed Types Further

If you want to enforce stricter typing:
- Allow only registers and constants
- Disallow direct symbols unless explicitly allowed

You could define:

```scheme
(define (valid-op-arg? exp)
  (or (register-exp? exp)
      (constant-exp? exp)))

(define (make-operation-exp op exp machine labels operations)
  (let ((arg-exps (operation-arg-exps exp)))
    (for-each (lambda (e) (if (label-exp? e) (error "Invalid operand: label used in operation")))
              arg-exps)
    ... ; proceed with lambda
```

This ensures that even before running, the machine won't assemble if a label appears inside an operation.

## üìä Summary Table

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Goal | Prevent using labels in operations like `+`, `-`, `=`, etc. |
| Problem | Current system treats labels as numeric addresses |
| Solution | Modify `get-value` to disallow label usage in ops |
| Real-World Analogy | Like preventing function pointers from being treated as integers |
| Key Procedure | `get-value` ‚Äì controls what kinds of expressions can be evaluated |

---

## üí° Final Thought

This exercise shows how subtle design decisions can lead to **unexpected behavior** in low-level systems.

By default, labels are resolved into instruction positions ‚Äî often numeric.
- This means you can accidentally treat them like numbers in operations
- Which leads to **nonsensical results**

By modifying `get-value`, you make the system **safer**:
- You prevent accidental use of labels in math operations
- You catch errors early, during assembly

It's a great example of how to enforce **type safety** in a minimalistic machine language.

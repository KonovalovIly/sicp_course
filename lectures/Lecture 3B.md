# Summary

The lecture, led by a professor, delves into the concept of building robust systems in computer science, focusing on how to create solutions that remain stable despite small changes in the underlying problems. The professor emphasizes continuity in the space of solutions, advocating for solving a class of problems rather than singular issues. By leveraging a well-defined language, systems can address solutions with minimal modifications.

The discussion progresses into algebraic expressions and the derivatives of functions. The key takeaway is that while calculating derivatives‚Äîa generally simpler task‚Äîone can utilize a structured program approach, using established calculus rules as the foundation. The professor contrasts this with the complexity of finding integrals, highlighting the inherent challenges in determining appropriate methods when faced with different problem directions.

The lecture becomes technical as the professor outlines the process of writing a program to compute derivatives based on fundamental calculus rules. He illustrates the recursive nature of this programming and language embedding through examples, emphasizing syntax and the importance of structure in both language design and mathematical expression manipulation.

The session culminates in introducing a verification process against computational results, where simplification and clarity in output are pursued. Ultimately, the professor envisions the potential for creating even more sophisticated languages through the manipulation of algebraic expressions, showcasing the power embedded in language structure and the crucial role of simplification for efficiency.

## What is procedure

Start of lection is talk about derivatives / integrals / differentiations

``` lisp
(define (deriv exp var)
	(cond
		((constant? exp var) 0)
		((same-var? exp var) 1)
		((sum? exp) 
			(make-sum (deriv (A1 exp) var) (deriv (A2 exp) var)))
		((product? exp)
			(make-sum
				(make-sum (M1 exp) (deriv (M2 exp) var))
				(make-sum (deriv (M1 exp) var) (M2 exp))
			)
		)
		....
	)
)
```

## List structure

atom? - that means what wariable is atomic and not a list
``` lisp
(define (constant? exp var)
	(and (atom? exp)
		(not (eq? exp var))
	)
)

(define (same-var? exp var)
	(and (atom? exp)
		(eq? exp var)
	)
)
```
## Quatation 

\` - quatation. It means next thing will be word - not a variable
``` lisp 
(define (sum? exp)
	(and (not (atom? exp))
		(eq? (car exp) `+)
	)
)

(define (make-sum a1 a2)
	(list `+ a1 a2)
)

(define a1 cadr) - it like (car (cdr x))
(define a2 caddr)- it like (car (cdr (cdr x)))

(define (product? exp)
	(and (not (atom? exp))
		(eq? (car exp) `x)
	)
)

(define (make-product m1 m2)
	(list `* m1 m2)
)

(define m1 cadr) - it like (car (cdr x))
(define m2 caddr)- it like (car (cdr (cdr x)))
```

## Transparency
We can hide things what less metter.
``` lisp
(define (make-sum a1 a2)
	(cond 
		((and (number? a1) (number? a2)) (`+ a1 a2))
		((and (number? a1) (= 0 a1)) a2)
		((and (number? a2) (= 0 a2)) a1)
	)
)
```
After this manipulation we have better output

# Key Insights
üì¶ Continuity in Solution Space: The idea that solutions must maintain continuity despite minor alterations in the problem provides a blueprint for robust systems. This continuity ensures that systems can adapt and evolve with minimal effort.

üìà Efficiency Through Classification: By classifying problems and constructing solutions for these classes, developers can reduce the complexity of individual instances, streamlining the problem-solving process and enhancing maintainability.

üîç Simplicity of Derivatives: Derivatives can be calculated using structured programming easily due to consistent mathematical rules, which promote an efficient recursion pattern. This contrasts sharply with integrals, where the lack of clear paths complicates the solution.

‚öôÔ∏è Language Representation and Expression: Using the language itself to define the constructs that operate on mathematical expressions enhances expressiveness, allowing for powerful manipulations that leverage syntax for robust programming techniques.

üîÑ Construct Establishing Clarity: When formulizing complex expressions using a program or algorithm, achieving clear and simplified outputs (e.g., avoiding redundant terms or zero values) results in more understandable results that are easier to analyze and verify.

üíî Pitfalls of Quotation in Representation: The professor highlights potential ambiguities introduced by quotation and representation in language, warning against misinterpretation, which necessitates addressing complex nuances in logic and syntax.

üîó Layered Language Development: The capacity to create languages that manipulate their own expressions signifies a profound advancement in programming, enabling the development of meta-languages that amplify computational power and extend capabilities beyond traditional boundaries.

By showcasing these insights, the lecture not only educates on the mechanics of derivatives but also elevates discussions about programming languages, emphasizing their critical role in effective and efficient system design.

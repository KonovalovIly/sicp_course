# Summary

The lecture presented by the professor revolves around the concept of symbolic manipulation in programming, specifically focusing on the development of a new programming language designed to effectively implement calculus rules as defined in traditional calculus texts. The core idea is to create a language that allows calculus rules to be more naturally expressed and understood by computers, which contrasts with the typical method of forcing existing calculus rules into computational frameworks. The lecture outlines how mathematical rules consist of a matching left-hand side and a transformatively defined right-hand side, where patterns, or “skeletons,” define how expressions can be instantiated into new forms.

The professor highlights the need for a versatile simplifier program, capable of handling various mathematical processes like derivatives and algebraic simplification without necessitating separate programs for each rule. By analyzing calculus differentiation rules, the professor showcases the ease of representing these rules in the new language via pattern variables that support dynamic expression matching. The simplifier program, referred to as dsimp, will recursively apply the relevant rules to the user’s input, highlighting the necessity for a matcher that establishes a mapping between expressions and patterns.

Challenges such as potential infinite loops in rule definitions and the underlying design of the programming language are also discussed, emphasizing the importance of constructing a robust matcher that processes patterns without errors. The professor concludes by discussing the instantiation process, which relies on recursively evaluating expressions against a dictionary, and the intricacies involved in designing a simplifier that builds upon user-defined rules. The ultimate objective is to create a flexible and scalable language solution that effectively manages symbolic manipulation tasks.

## Rules

Patterns -> Skeleton (Rule)
Patterns - what are we mattcing
Patterns match expression
Expressions Source -> Expression Target
Skeleton -> Expression Target

We build a language with using rules and patterns

## Syntax
 Pattern Match

foo - matching exactly foo
(f a b) - match f to 2 vatiables
(? x) - match anything, call is x
(?c x) - match a constant, call is x
(?v x) - match a variable, call is x

## Skeletons

foo - instantiates to it self
(f a b) - instantiates to a list of 3 elements wich result of inst ich of f a b
(: x) - instantiates to the value of x

``` lisp

(define dsimp
	(simplifier deriv-rules)
)

(dsimp `(dd (+ x y) x)) => (+ 1 0)

```

Each rule have pattern and skeleton

## The Matcher

It has a input (Expression, Pattern, Dictuanary (Pattern -> Expression)), and output of Dictionari expression by the patterns

Matcher compare of trees of patterns and tree of resulted expressions.
